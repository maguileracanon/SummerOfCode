So I cannot you know devote my whole attention to whatever's on t.v. 'cause you know there's other stuff that you know I just want to do at the same time, so if I'm watching like news or if I'm watching you know like a talk show or something, I can do everything at once. If I'm watching a movie or if I'm watching, I don't know, something that, you know, I can't really do it um so.
