It is fabulous to encourage moving and crawling as I set them around him and they slide away as he reaches for them -- its been invaluable in encouraging him towards crawling and scooting. When he does get hold of them, exploring the ladder on the fire truck develops his fine motor skills too, and he like chewing on all of them and shaking the rattly little one!  He'll probably soon be able to work the sun roof. It will be a stacking toy later too! Great value for money...\n",

However, when you get home you do not have a nurse to remind you or ask when your baby's last bowel movement was and you are so overwhelmed with the new schedule you can't even remember what day it is. The daily tracker helped us so much because once we got home our baby cried all the time, could not sleep and we were having major problems breastfeeding. It was so bad we had to contact our pediatrician's after hours on-call doctor. Looking at the tracker we realized a trend, the baby was not feeding for a long time AND we had very few wet diapers and bowel movements. This was an indication our baby was dehydrated and the doctor suggested we start pumping breast milk (to see how much we get) and supplement with formula until sufficient breast milk finally came in. The feeding column we wrote how many ounces of breast milk or formula we gave and how long he breast fed for. In the comments column we use it for tracking how much water I drink because I was not drinking enough to make an adequate supply of breastmilk.

It is a 6 month diary and has room for notes.  I wish the hours started around 6 am and went until 8 pm, but we just write over certain times to suit our purposes. The nice thing is that if we had a rough night and we are super tired, we have something to refer to if we forgot when we last fed the baby or when he woke up. I also like that the front page has a place for emergency comments and a consent form in case your child needs medical care.  It also has a place at the back of the book for immunizations.  I'll definitely get another one in 6 months when we finish this book.\",\n",

If you are able to grab *both* your phone and this notebook - and a pen - consistently - and at 3 in the morning - you are more skilled than me.  (I don't nurse in the same place every time.)2.) You're also often so sleep deprived that - at least for me - I'd forget to look at what time we started on a side, or what side we started on.  I'm not perfect with the app I have either, but at least I just have to mindlessly hit a button.3.) I really like the app I have (Baby Connect).  It gives me better data.  For example, it can tell me how long on average feedings have been taking (helpful as we start to think about sleep training).

When you are sleep deprived and learning everything for the first time, you don't know which way is up or down sometimes. It can be extremely overwhelming, especially when breastfeeding every 2 hours. This book is a life-saver. It literally never left my side for the first 6 months. (I bought a second one after the 3 months one was done.)I used it to keep track of diaper changes and what kind (pee/poop), naps, and how long my baby nursed on each side. I also wrote notes for each day so I could see a history of reactions/milestones. It made it easier to figure out what gave my baby gas or why she slept better on certain days.Coupled with the Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Timer (which is also a necessity), I never really lost track (or my mind). It's also great for care-takers too, especially when they are picking up for an hour or two when you run out.Please get this for anyone you know who is expecting a baby and they will thank you!

You can keep track of anything your baby does, from eating and sleeping and diapering to all the other things they do like first smile and first laugh. I only wish that instead of being 3 months it would be longer, like 6 months or even 1 year. I would definitely recommend for the first months of your baby's life.\",\n",

It's a great way to see a new infants progression toward feeding and sleeping schedules. In the sleep deprived first weeks it was so helpful in keeping track of diaper count, feeding sides,  etc. Once we introduced solid foods, I could track when I offered new foods to watch for signs of intolerance.  I just purchased again for new baby's arrival. I highly recommend for new or seasoned moms.\",\n",

The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.\",\n",

The velcro spots are a little small and flimsy.Page 2: Clock - the hands move freely, well constructed (my daughter isn't ready to learn the time but likes moving the arrows and talking about numbers)Page 3: Buttoning flowers to same colored buttons (this is too hard for my daughter to accomplish but I have her tell me where to button it by matching colors)Page 4: Tie the shoe - wish the string were a little longer which would make the task easierPage 5: Zip up the dress - my little one likes zippers - wish it had the ability to zip completely open so she could practice matching up the ends of the zipperPage 6: Buckle the pants buckle - this one is tricky!Page 7: Snap balloons on to color matched strings - the plastic snaps take a decent amount of pressure to apply and are a little hard to accomplishPage 8: 4 different texture and color swatchesOverall I think this book will last a long time and my daughter will be able to appreciate it more as she grows older.\",\n",

The reason I bought it was because it was in-expensive and easy for him to hold & pick up. He would rather pick up a toy car, or some sort of stuffed toy, which I understand every child is different. My only big complaint - the star bead on the end. It is hard, and pointy. If it catches my son's sore, in-coming teeth the wrong way, he will cry. Other then that, the colors are great, and definitely catch baby's eye. Overall, it's an OK toy for the price.\",\n",

It was good to use while in the grocery store.  However, it pulled hard on my shoulder.Now, he's 7 months old, and he's crawling and pulling himself up, and he doesn't like to be restrained at all.  I've tried the kangaroo position, but I'm so scared he's going to fall out the bottom because he is quite a wiggle worm.

Also, my husband would load the diaper into the top but routinely forget to flip it over to dump the dirty diaper.  Now I lift the whole lid and toss the diaper in, this allows me to keep tabs on how full it's getting and squeeze in a few extra that the mechanism wouldn't have allowed... and still trap the smell!

My favorite feature is that it doesn't require special refills--it can use any trash bag (we just use a tall kitchen trash bag).  My 3 1/2 year old still hasn't figured out how to open it, but it's easy enough for me to open quickly.  The only times I have had a problem with odors is if too many diapers are stuffed into the pail.  Even then, these odors can be minimized with a bit of baking soda sprinkled in the bottom of the pail.Although I debate the necessity of ANY diaper pail, this one receives 5 stars from me!\",\n",

This included reading reviews, asking friends (lots) about products that did and didn't work for them, and actually trying to use some of the products.  I decided to go w/ the Diaper Champ after learning that the overwhelming majority of my friends absolutely hated that leading diaper pail the Diaper Genie and actually trying to use that awful contraption.  In fact in one circle of friends the Diaper Genie was re-gifted about four times b/c they were simply trying to get rid of it. I also did not like the idea of having to buy the special bags that the Diaper Genie requires.  The diaper champ uses regular kitchen bags. I have NEVER experienced an odor problem.  If you want to thwart an odor problem do the following:-Fold the diaper over and close it.-Remember to change the bags!!!  I usually change mine twice a week on garbage day.-You still have to clean the thing!! I usually spray the inside w/ Lysol when I change the bag and/ or wipe it w/ antibacterial wipes.  On occasion I wipe it w/ cleaner just as I would clean by bathroom.-For those complaining about toddler diaper odors.  Toddlers eat solids, their poop smell very adult like!  We have to do things to banish odors from our toilets, the same has to be done for toddler diapers whether you use this product or any other.This product has been a life saver and I recommend it highly.\",\n",

Now that we have this one, he loves it. It's so easy to flip the lid and away goes the diaper. No twisting till your wrist breaks. At first we were using scented trashbags, but I've switched to grocery bags and they work just as well. I change the bag about once a week with either kind of bags. My son is now three months old and wears size 3 diapers. The only problem we've had is that if you don't close the diaper tapes they can stick and jam the pail.

I usually wipe the Champ off with a Clorox Wipe each time I change the bag, but my husband decided to take apart the Champ a few weeks ago to give it a thorough cleaning with some bleach water, and he mentioned that the gaskets were looking worn out.  So, I called Baby Trend (Diaper Champ manufacturer) and they sent me to two new gaskets and two new piston rings (which I didn't even ask for) for FREE!  The customer service rep. even told me to call and request more gaskets and rings when we notice that the new ones start to wear out, usually after about 6 months.

I didn't have to spend loads of money on the special Diaper Genie bags anymore, it had far superior odor control as compared to the Easy Saver Diaper Pail, and it's really easy to use - drop a diaper in, flip the handle over, done!  I actually developed pain in my elbow from all the twisting the Diaper Genie required as it wrapped each diaper into its little sausage-like casing.

The second is that it doesn't twist shut like the genie does so when you open up the pail you smell all the lovely smells. The last is that it's top heavy when you open it up to put in the bag so you have to manuever it to put the bag in so it doesn't fall over but it can be done. That's the only time it smells though. My baby is breast fed so the smell isn't as bad as formula fed babies but our room smells fresh and clean. These minor details wouldn't make me change my mind.

       "  'reviewText': \"I spent a lot of time researching diaper pails before I actually bought one. I spoke to other parents to see what they used and most said that the Diaper Champ was leaps and bounds better than the alternatives. Now, owning one myself, I agree. I don't have any problems with oders (uless I'm changing out the bag) and I don't have to spend tons of money on the refill bags. You will be suprised how many diapers you change and how quickly the cost of those refills add up! My son is now 3 months old and we are still on our first box of kitchen sized trash bags....I have two very small complaints which is why I didn't give the Diaper Champ 5 stars. First, I think that it could have been made a little larger so you wouldn't have to change the bags as often. Second, you have to be VERY careful when changing out the bags. The lid is heavy and if it falls on your fingers you won't be really happy. It probably happens to everyone at least once. Overall this is an excellent product and I recommend it over all others out there.\",\n",

However if you keep up with the maintance that problem is easily solved.Problem:  SmellAnswer:  Baking soda & regular maintanceThe great thing about the diaper champ is you can use regular bags, and it does keep the smell out. After some time with the Diaper Genie there was no way to stop the odor.Another thing, when the Champ starts stinking it is usaully past time to empty it. Empty the champ at least twice a week, if not more. We keep an air purifier in front of the diaper champ and that solves any strong smells when we don't empty it out on a regular basis.If you don't want to spend the money on the diaper champ, try a regular diaper pail with a lid. You would more than likely end up emptying the pail daily and that will keep the smell out(plus regulare maintance), and it is less expensive than the Diaper Champ.There are three diaper pails out that are cheaper:Safety 1st Diaper Pail: 8 gallons it's  a bit small$9.99 at Target & Babies R UsOdorless Diaper Pail: 13 gallons bags @ Target $16.99Easy Saver Daiper Pail: 8 gallons $14.99 @ Babies R UsI have not tried any of these so I can't honestly review them. These are if you are looking for cheaper alternative. I would buy one of these over the Diaper Genie or Diaper Dekor.I still give it 4 stars. It does it job and a lot better than the Diaper Genie or Diapre Dekor, no expensive refills. Everyone has kitchen trash bags that can be used with the Champ or regular grocery bags could be put to use. The good thing about using grocery bags is you will be emptying the diaper champ on a dialy basis therefore elimating build up on odor.I have the older diaper champ and opening the lid to empty the pail was a bit of a hassle. It is enough of a detterent. You get the hang of it.\",\n",

Someone gave me the Neat diaper disposal system for my baby shower & I absolutely loved it. However, the handle broke on it just 2 weeks ago. I thought...\"Maybe I could try the Diaper Champ since I won\\'t have to purchase any liners\"...Well that was a HUGE mistake!! I see why this thing got 4 stars--all of these parents have young children!! My daughter is 14 months old & because she is older, I guess her diapers come with more odor! After literally only a few diapers, her entire room smelled of poop! I couldn\\'t stand it! In one week, I changed the garbage bag at least 4 times. Is that really saving money?? I don\\'t think so! Plus her room really smelled bad. I\\'m taking it back & getting the Neat again! The Diaper Champ must be great for infants, but you may want to consider something else for older babies!',\n",

What a disappointment!  Here are the big two complaints:1.  It's unsanitary.  Putting diapers and messy wipes into the slot and dumping them in the bucket leaves the slot a germy mess.  Having to clean the slot each and every time is just unrealistic and too much work!  And I fear our toddler getting anywhere near the thing because of the germs.2.  The smell.  It's probably not as bad with an infant, but let me tell you, opening the lid to empty toddler diapers is one frightening experience!  Yikes, what a smell after just a couple days.  We used the odor prevention garbage bags, but nothing prepared me for that odor when I opened the lid.  Since nothing seals off the individual diapers, it's just a sea of messy diapers in there.  Yuck.On the plus side, it's wonderful to be able to use regular garbage bags, not the expensive ones the Genie requires.  And it's certainly easy to use.  But I'm not sure how this product is any better than just using a garbage can with a lid.When our second child arrives next year, we'll be going back to the Diaper Genie.  It's not perfect, but it's much cleaner and there's less odor involved (the reason to get one of these products in the first place).  And the new version of the Genie is much easier to operate than the earlier model, so we'll just cross our fingers the lid stays attached next time.\",\n",

Finally, after two months of dealing with this pail, one morning, I flipped the handle, and the cylinder fell right into the bottom of the pail.  (It was not a pleasant task to retrieve it, either!)  I haven't been able to figure out how to fix it, so we are using a Safety 1st Diaper Pail now, and the Diaper Champ will be hauled to the road for the trash pickup next week.  I think that for the price, it should have lasted longer than two months.  I do not recommend this product.\",\n",

When my daughter turned one, she started disposing of her diapers herself and she never failed!We used regular grocery bags and changed them twice a week to avoid them getting too full and/or smelly. [We've discovered that regular shopping bags from Target are larger and sturdier than your average grocery bag and we're now using them with daughter #2, replacing them once a week]. We have NEVER had any problems with DiaperChamp, and we're still using the one that we purchased in 2001! It's virtually indestructible, easy to wash and operate, doesn't cost you any more money than you initially pay for it, and it DOES NOT SMELL!I would highly recommend this product to anyone.\",\n",

We can use our regular garbage bags so the cost is very minimal and we don't have to worry about going out and buying those special bags like for the Diaper Genie.We use cloth diapers and it works really well for that.  We change the bag almost daily, as we have two in diapers and cloth diapers are bulkier.  When it gets hard to turn, it is time to change the bag!The Diaper champ really minimizes the odor and is very easy to clean up, we just wipe it with a soapy cloth and sometimes spray a little disinfectant to help with the smell.This is great and I would recommend it for everyone.\",\n",

I love the fact that the Diaper Champ accepts any kind of bag, and you don't have to purchase specific bags.  That's way too much of a headache and expense that I don't need.  It's also super easy to use one-handed which is important with a squirmy infant either in your arms or on the changing table.  It took me a few minutes to learn how to change the bag, but that, too, is easy once you figure it out.  We haven't had a problem at all with the smell, but we do wipe it out with Clorox wipes every so often just to make sure.  This is one of those baby items I wouldn't want to do without.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail. I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags. Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!! I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.' In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!! I change mine about 1 or 2 times a week. For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!! Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!! Hello, it does house dirty diapers!! All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two. SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind:AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful. Again, this is because as their diet changes, so does the consistency and odor of their stool, in other words, it gets stinkier!!!All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.\",\n",

Therefore, I found it both quicker and easier just to take the mattress out all together and use fitted sheets (which are also more attractive).  I would only use this product if you have a mattress/crib set that have a fit making it extremely difficult to get the mattress out.

The first time I tried to put in on the mattress, I was fussing and swearing at it and was sweating my butt off trying to get it hooked on. It is not intuitive at all to snap on:1) The snap bands aren't placed equidistant so you just have to guess at where they should go.2) In order to snap the opposite side you have to lean over and INTO the crib (or you have to pull it away from the wall)...3) All while trying to stick your fingers through the slats to pull the bands through and snap them.4) Once I had the bands hooked where it seemed they should...I got to the opposite end and there was NO WAY the bands were hooking--it was a few inches too short! GRRRRRRR!At that point, sweaty and frustrated, I gave up and threw the damn thing at my husband and told him to do it. Since then, I've had to do it myself, and I still hate it although I am getting better.The pros?It is nicely waterproof. When the boy spits up or his diaper leaks or he sweats a lot, it does not make it through to the mattress. But that said, it's not like there's a lot of liquid to worry about.We haven't had any issue with the snaps not staying snapped or the baby getting underneath the sheet.Overall?We are still using this, although I am not quite sure why. There has to be another solution that doesn't cause me mental anguish trying to put it on (although, honestly, sheets of any kind are a PITA). So I give it three stars, but with a warning that it's a pain to put on.\",\n",

My baby would sweat profusely.  We always keep our house at 68-70 and dressed him in a cotton sleeper.  If he was laying on his back, his chest would be cool, but his back would be hot and sticky.  Or if laying on his stomach, his front would be sweaty, but his back cool.  Basically, whatever was touching the mattress pad could not breath and it was uncomfortable no matter what temperature adjustment we made.I will say the design configuration is very practical and a great idea.  Changing a fitted mattress sheet is a giant pain in the butt.  This pad makes it easy to clean up the crib after an accident and speed is critical in the middle of the night.I purchased a felted 100% wool mattress pad instead and couldn't be happier.  It was slightly more expensive, but it was worth it.  Wool is a truly fabulous product: very breathable, helps regulate body temp, naturally water resistant, anti bacterial and NATURAL!!!!  No man-made plastics or vinyl that you have to worry about weird off-gassing chemicals.  My baby stays dry and comfortable.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Yes, scratchy!  I was quite surprised by the rough texture of the top layer of the sheet.  It feels like very cheap, low thread count material, not nearly as soft as most bedsheets.  When my daugher used this sheet, she had a skin rash and started getting a bold spot on the back of her head.  It's possible, of course, that these were unrelated to the sheet.  However, both problems improved substantially when we removed it and put her on a softer, normal bed sheet.Also, I agree with another poster that this could be a dangerous product, especially if your baby is older and moves around her crib a lot.  There is no way to tuck the sides under, as with a regular sheet, so a baby could find her way under the sheet and suffocate.  Keep in mind, too, that undoing the snaps is very easy--so easy, a baby could do it!  The elastic bands connecting the sheet to the crib also make me nervous.  Could an older baby pinch or strangle herself in these?My daughter is now six months, and rolls around her crib.  I won't be regularly using this sheet anymore.  But, there is an upside.  This product is AMAZINGLY easy to use.  Snap, snap--that's it.  There is no lifting the mattress.  And it is waterproof underneath (unlike a certain zipper sheet, I could name), so in an emergency you don't have to worry about the mattress.  Recently, my daughter had a stomach virus, diarrhea everywhere.  To make matters worse, I caught it and was too light-headed to lift a 20lb crib mattress.  This sheet was perfect.\",\n",

My 4-year old has slept in a full-size bed since he turned 2.  These pads really work (no leaks!), are comfortable and wash-up well.  I only have 2 complaints ... 1. the side-flaps aren\\'t quite long enough to fully tuck under if you have a pillow-top mattress (although you can make it work if one side of the bed is against the wall and you pull the opposite side really tight)  AND  2. the top and bottom of the pad tend to \"curl up\" after several washings.  Despite these complaints, I have not been able to find a pad that is even near the quality and comfort of this one.  The reason that I own 5 of these is that, if you truly want \"full\" coverage on the bed for a child that rolls all over while sleeping, you need to use 2 with some slight overlap (so, 2 to use and 2 for back-up).  I also use one (full-size) on the Spinmaster Flip-Open Sofa to keep spills and accidents from staining the sofa.  The full-size fully covers the full-length of the sofa.  I think this is a \"must have\" product for parents of toddlers that don\\'t want to be constantly changing bed sheets or trying to \"wash\" a children\\'s sofa that really isn\\'t meant to be washed.(fyi ...

I clip the hanger off and break it in half (while it's still in the plastic) and add half or both, just depends.  The deodorizers last about 1-2 months and it's cheap! I empty it about every 3 days and spray it down w/ Lysol before adding another bag.  Not had any stinky problems and this is in my hallway right by the familyroom. I do take it outside every month and give it a good cleaning w/ bleach and a garden hose.\",\n",

Then, when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes. Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags. We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product. Odor-Less - No. We empty it as needed, usually once a week, and realize it's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail.

       "  'reviewText': \"I tried to use this power strip cover for about 2 months when our twin daughters were 8-10 months old. It was frustrating for my husband & I -- hard to get the power strip inside, hard to keep things plugged in, and too big to hide out of the babies view (not to mention that it's bulky and a bit ugly). For the babies, it became yet another interesting thing around the house that we had to wrestle from their hands. They were able to unplug the cords easily and were starting to reach their fingers into the top hole when I finally gave up on using it. Yes, the cover did keep the babies from actually touching the outlets in the power strip, but I could have accomplished the same thing with a couple of normal outlet covers.In the end, I rearranged our cords making the power strip & this cover unnecessary. It was just too annoying to keep using the cover.\",\n",

And it adjusts lengthwise so you can make it pretty long if you need it to.  Some other reviews mention the size of the opening on the top - it's true, it's surprisingly wide, I can usually reach in enough to pull out a plug when I need to, rather than opening the whole thing.  So could your kid conceivably pull one of your plugs out when you don't want him/her to?  Sure, but the cover is also tall enough that it would be pretty darn hard for them to stick their fingers down into the open sockets.  Bottom line: treat this as a deterrent and not a substitute for knowing when your kid's playing with power cords.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"As with everything about being a parent, locks are more complicated than you'd have thought (or would like!):SCREW-MOUNTED MAGNETIC LOCKS:  The Safety 1st Tot-Lok Locks can be difficult to install, especially on drawers, but have more flexibility about where you can install the lock than the adhesive locks and seem very secure.  Still, most people may want to try the adhesive locks (see below) first, to make it easier to get some child proofing done quickly.Pros:+ Very nice & secure once installed, especially since the fit can be adjusted to give a tight lock when closed.+ Works vertically or horizontally ... that is, on the side of a door or the top.+ Can easily be switched to hold the lock open, for when no children are aroundCons:- Complicated to install, especially in some situations.  So you might not get around to installing them, given all the other demands on your time.- Requires drilling a hole partway through the cabinet door from the inside for the magnetic part, plus some small holes to attach- May require some new tools - a collar lock, to keep from drilling through the door; and a right angle chuck for tight spacesIf you plan to be in your home for a while, and want a finished, secure set of locks, the Tot Loks may be a good choice.One note, if you use them often the magnetic key will wear the finish where it rubs.ADHESIVE MOUNT MAGNETIC LOCKS: The KidCo Adhesive Mount Magnet Locks will only work in some spots, but it's still a good lock to try first, for a lot of people, because it works well (in the right situations) and is easy to install.  Buy some and see how they work on your cabinets.  Once you've tried a few, it's a lot easier to see where'll they'll work or won't work.Pros:+ Quick to install, after a few minutes of figuring it out+ No drilling required, so less work and no damage to furniture or cabinetsCons:- Only installs horizontally (along the top edge of a door or drawer), given the way they use gravity to lock.We just use the adhesive mount, no additional screws, for some furniture we didn't want to drill holes into.  They seem to be strong enough so far, especially since our kids seem to give up trying a door after a while - if it won't open, they lose interest.  I don't know how the adhesive would stand up to long term use or really heavy pulling.HOOK LOCKS:  The advantage that either of the magnetic locks has over the old fashioned hook type (like theMommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock) is that the hooks have a lot more play (they have to open a little bit to give you access to the lock). So a child can bang them back and forth - they might not open the door or drawer, but they will make a racket.  Maybe OK in some situations, but not a great solution for easily accessible drawers or doors.SLIDE LOCKS:  Slide locks (such as theAmerican Red Cross Cabinet Safety Slide Lock) are very quick and easy to install, if they fit.  But they can also be pretty easy for some kids to unlock, so if they are within reach they aren't much of a barrier to older kids.  And even younger kids can sometimes open them by pulling or pushing on the doors.  However, they are a good temporary solution and can be useful to carry when you travel.FLEX LOCKS:  Flex locks (like the Safety First Cabinet Flex-Lock (see reviews) orCabinet Flex-Lock 2-Pack) are strong and easy to install, and you can see by looking at them whether the lock is secure (unlike the magnetic locks, which are designed to be out of sight).  So you might want to use them for critical spots such as under the sink; or use them when you travel.  And as a bonus, they are so secure that even some adults can't open them! ;-)  (They do take two hands to open.)  Not attractive, but they do the job if you keep them tightened.\",\n",

I am frustrated that I will have to drill more holes into my cabinet and there is no guarantee that it will work!\",\n",

Visitors to the house found it impossible to work, because we had to have the magnet positioned just so.  That is actually a good safety feature, because the kids know the magnet opens the drawers and would attempt to open the drawers when they get their hands on the magnet.As far as keeping the kids out, it worked well.  I'd say it's been in our drawer for about six years.  We no longer use it and it hasn't worked well for about a year or so.  The magnet no longer unlatches the lock and we can't get into the drawer.This is a good lock, but require the willingness to drill into the woodwork of your cabinets.  It takes work for people to learn.  I think it should have lasted longer than five years, but maybe that's all most people need.  4 stars for the fact that it does what it's designed to do but not 5 stars, because it has issues.\",\n",

All three of these nail trimmers are in the \"Hospital\\'s Choice\" series.Overall, I prefer the 49523/49539 model (see Customer Images) because it is more comfortable to hold for the following reasons.  First, instead of a small white plastic bulb, the 49523/49539 has a larger white-and-orange or white-and-blue handle that allows you to hold the clippers like a \"gun\" with your index finger under the blades and your thumb on the lever.  Second, the orange or blue part of the 49523/49539 handle is soft and less slippery than the white plastic of this model.  Third, the lever has the same soft orange or blue non-skid rubbery material at the end, thus providing a cushion for your thumb.In terms of cutting nails, the very good performance of this model and the 49523/49539 are the same. (They both leave the nail edges a little sharp, so some filing is necessary.) So I recommend purchasing the 49523/49539 instead.',\n",

I've tried this in my mouth, it isn't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done, this was over 2 minutes so I don't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them. I've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out, even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue, they HATE it. My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally, it IS very easy and the most accurate. I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp. If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature. I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality, they just don't work and I'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing.\",\n",

I bought this when I was pregnant because I thought it would be a brilliant way to measure a babys temperature but I was wrong... As a new mom I was wrong about a number of things... this was one of them. No baby is going to keep a pacifier in his mouth long enough to actually get the temperature measured if it is not his (her) pacifier that he (she) loves and always uses. Any baby will identify this as a strange object and spit it out immediately, its too heavy. Especially if the baby is not feeling well. Don't buy this. Get a real thermometer.\",\n",

His leg was all scrunched up, his head fell to one side (unpadded, by the way), and it was hard to fit it over my bathroom sink because it's a small round thing. Anyway, before I had the baby, I bought my husband a bath head cushion (the kind you blow up) from Target which he never used (too girly I guess). Turns out it is the perfect cushion (it has suction cups) to attach inside our sink and put baby in for baths. It has grooves so baby's head doesn't flop everywhere. I bath baby in no time and I have the water running because he loves the feel of water streaming down onto his body. The cushion also allows me to flip baby over so I can wash his back. He just lies on the soft terry cloth. It's perfect.\",\n",

I like the portability and the fact that it can fold up and fit under the bathroom counter, since his bathroom is also the guest bathroom.  I also like the little section in the front.  That's where I put the soapy water.  It's easy to rinse him off with a little watering can.  The tub has been great, but now that my son is 17 lbs. it's getting small.

Its ability to be easily stored was a big plus in the hospital, as well as at home.  The NICU nurse recommended that we line any infant tub with one of those baby bath sponges (ours is yellow and in the shape of a bear).  We use our tub in the kitchen sink.  Leaks, pinches and mildew have never been a problem.  Oddly enough, we have found that our baby likes to sit in the tub backwards (once she could hold up her head).  This positon is more upright and also makes it easier to wash her hair.  We use the kitchen sprayer on low and place a washcloth over our baby's torso which we frequently re-wet with warm water to keep her from getting cold.  Our baby is still a bit small for 4 months, but we anticipate that this tub will work for several more months.  Our baby loves bath time!- Our baby is now 8 months old and about 16 pounds.  We have used this infant tub up until this point and are just now graduating to the big tub.  This fold-up tub was a great purchase for us!\",\n",

I followed all the directions, I was very careful and patient with this tub, I washed it and dried it after each use and still I find things growing in the crevices and between the top and bottom. The design idea was good but it just isn't practical for a baby tub that will need to be used regularly. The sling slips out of place all the time and the bath ring isn't worth the extra work it takes to clean it and the little ridges that hold it into the tub. No matter how hard I work it's impossible to keep this tub clean.\",\n",

Here\\'s how it happens: Once the tub is full expanded and the clips under the side are \"clicked\" into place (and yes, we did read the instructions) we fill the tub. Once we finish bathing her, we slide the entire unit forward just enough so that the drain hangs over the edge of the sink and let the water drain. It is at this point that by moving the tub, the suction cups stick to the counter and while moving the tub, it unhooks the clips and out come the waterworks....all over the hardwood floors. And let me tell you, it isn\\'t easy to remedy this while holding a wet, squirmy baby. Mothers (and fathers) have far better things to do with their time than fiddle with the damn clips and mop up a huge mess. My husband, an MD and engineer says it is obviously incapable of maintaining a reliable seal. Look at it! Meanwhile, we\\'re shopping for a different type of tub.

In the beginning, we used the infant sling, but my baby would constantly slip down into the water.  We had to put a large bear-shaped foam bath sponge between him and the sling to minimize the slipping, but we still had to readjust him quite frequently.  When he learned to sit on his own, we tried using the bath seat feature.  He would arch his back and slip forward into the bath ring, thus painfully squishing his private parts.  We decided to try it without the ring and it was a little challenging holding him in place while washing him, but we managed.  Now he twists and turns and won't stay put in the tub.  I have thought about buying a better tub, but since we are so close to graduating him to the big tub, I don't want to spend the money.  Please consider buying something different for your baby.  I will not be using this tub for my next child.\",\n",

The newborn sling is nice, and lets baby have contact with the water without feeling overwhelmed.  Our baby didn't really like bath time until he could sit up by himself, and at that point this bath tub became a necessity.  Baby loves to explore the tub, and the secure bath ring helps keep him safely and securely in one place.  He is now almost 20 mos and we still use it with the bath ring in place because he likes it better that way, too!  I especially like it because I don't have to worry about him slipping under the water accidentally if I look away for a second to get his towel ready or something.  We had a problem with leaking at first, too, but once we read the instructions and pushed the bottom down securely, we haven't had a problem since.\",\n",

We received the four stage bath system and it was horrible the baby just did not fit in it right. Therefore, I upgraded to the leachco bath ring...once again nothing but disappointment. I was resolved to washing the baby in the sink, but at 7 months that was just too hard for me to do alone; he was slippery and squirmy just wanting to play! I happened to be out at Toy's r us and they were having a sale so I picked up the tub thinking what the heck lets see if this works. So far, it has been great. No leaks, he is very secure (obviously, you stay with them) and it is so simple clean. My only issue is the tub is large and we have a small bathroom.

We soon found that while these are very sturdy and adaptable, they are tall enough that they are a hassle to step over. At least once a week, my husband or I will catch a toe or scrape a shin stepping over. So if you intend to use this fence as a corral, either indoors or out, this is a Great Buy. If you are planning to use it as a fence to block off a wide opening, pay the extra money for the metal version with the gate. you (and your toes) will be much happier.\",\n",

This play yard fits great in our living room, yet there's plenty of room for him to roll around in all directions.  Also, I like that it's see-thru.  You can see  your baby (and he can see you) from across the room.  I don't care that it's not the most attractive thing.  It was affordable and it does the job.  And when our son starts crawling, we can completely close it and know that he won't be able to sneak off.  One suggestion I would make to the manufacturer though would be to pad or provide padding around the bottom, about six inches high.  My son falls asleep with his head on the edge all the time (NOT very comfortable), and when I move him away from it, he wakes up.  It'd be nice to not have to move him.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Superyard XT is an excellent product for child containment, providing exactly the protection a parent desires for outdoor play. It isn't a very large gate- even when fully extended, it covers an area only about the size of a medium to large playpen. But it offers enough space to keep one or two kids (and their toys) safely occupied.Superyard XT holds up well and I have left it outside during harsh weather conditions with no problems. It is very easy to clean and to transport. The panels fold together and the carrying strap makes the job even easier still. The panels do not fold completely flat- they do have some thickness, so don't expect this gate to fit into a tiny space. It needs at least enough space to accommodate the thickness when all six panels are folded together.The panels on Superyard XT are not very tall and because of this, the gate is good only for toddlers and other kids up to about two years of age. As children get older, they will be able to climb over the walls of the gate or possibly knock it down, making it impractical as a containment device. But the shorter height has one clear advantage: It makes it easy for parents because it can be stepped over. There is no need to dissemble the panels or open the gate to get inside.Superyard XT is solid and sturdy but consumers must be careful to position it properly. The gates cannot be placed in a straight line because the design of the gate diminishes its effectiveness when used in this manner. Each one of the joints has to be bent in order to become sturdy. Placed in a straight line, the gate cannot resist pressure and it will fall over with the slightest push.The only complaint I have with Superyard XT is the small space it covers. With the limited space, some people may have difficulty fitting even two kids inside the closed walls of the gate. Depending on the number of toys your kids have, one child might be all that will fit. This is why I strongly recommend purchasing an extension kit. This kit consists of two additional panels and while this doesn't sound like much, it increases the area substantially and it makes the gate capable of handling two kids with no problems.Overall, Superyard XT is a very good gate for child or pet containment. I brushed it off when I first saw it because it seemed like another useless product with limited use, marketed solely to take our hard earned money. But now that I own the Superyard, I cannot imagine life without this containment device. It offers kids a place to play where they are well- protected, giving parents some much needed peace of mind.\",\n",

The 'Superyard XT' is also great for puppies, and more humane than crating them for hours.  My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the gate that opens (so you can get in the 'Superyard') is awkward and somewhat difficult to work.

       "  'reviewText': 'I recently purchased this yard when my twins ((now nearly 8 months old)) started to become mobile.I have yet to baby-gate my entire house, but I have super-yard\\'ed the family room! I have it shaped as a square, and have those alphabet puzzle peice foam squares inside, to protect my carpet. The boys enjoy being able to actually see through the holes, and be able to play with many of their toys ((rather than being confined in a pack n play)). It is pretty sturdy if used properly, I mean if I or any other adult were to fall on it, obviously it would collapse. It DOES fold, but not at all compactly, and I would say that it would most-likely take up my entire mini-van trunk if I were to travel with it... so if you are looking for a compact on-the-go type of play-yard, look else-where. I do like that you can configure it to fit an oddly-shaped play area, or even remove/add panels ((sold separately which we did not buy)) to make it larger or smaller. Also, due to it being plastic ((very well rounded I may add, no sharp edges!)) we will be able to start bringing it outdoors as well now that the weather is improving!I also am planning on purchasing another one to use to \"gate off\" 2 over-sized entrance ways to my family room. My husband believes if we screw 3 hooks ((with the full hole, not the 1/2 hole) to either side of each door frame, and then attatch those strong zip-ties to the hooks and the holes in the gate, that it will work. Of course, this will do damage to our walls, but it is the only solution I see fit with such a large doorway ((please note that these are NOT meant for stairs, or doorways. They are NOT baby gates... this is just a creative suggestion I thought I would mention)). And, one of my friends owns one, and used it to surround her christmas tree last year, which I thought was an AMAZING idea!I think that once our boys master crawling, and eventually walking that the super-yard will prove even more valuable than it is now!',\n",

Definitely, a very sturdy gate that won't just fall apart when pulled or tagged by my son, now 14 months.  It doesn't even encourage him to climb up on its diagonal shaped railings, no matter how much he tries to.

The wall was too \"freeform\" to use regular 90-degree and straight-edge padding, so we figured by snaking this yard around the fireplace and entertainment center we\\'d pretty well babyproof the whole living room.

We use them as a deterant and NOT as a \"babysitter.\" Our daughter is always supervised, but it\\'s nice to have a \"split second accident preventer.\" In other words, it would take her some time to move the gate and go around it, by which time we would have caught her red-handed.

I expect a new product not to just pop right into position, but it formed a hexagon rather easily.  That's the key---no assembly required!  My daughter is 7 months old and when she pushes herself up on her front arms and tips over onto her back, she occasionally bonks her head on the &quot;wall&quot; of the pen.  She gave herself a nice red spot on her head when she hit the &quot;hinge joint&quot; part of the pen that concerned me, but it wouldn't be very effective if it wasn't sturdy.  The mesh lattice walls seem to have a little give in them.  To remedy it as best as I could, I have placed stuffed animals or larger toys in front of the corners.  I still think that her rare head bonks are a good trade off for other huge catastrophies that would be occuring daily in or house.  She doesn't protest to being put in it because she has a sense of freedom and scoots all around and is still be able to see us.  And we can keep an eye her as well.  It is the perfect size as not to intrude on living room space but big enough to hold her ever-growing little body and a ton of her toys.

The Superyard is fantastic when it comes to size and it very sturdy if you mount it to the wall or bolt it into the floors but we prefer not to put holes all over the walls or into our concrete slab. So we did not get to enjoy the gates fullest potential.The Good:1. Very tall2. Has options available to make it sturdy and permanent in placement.3. Able to see though the gates, great for both parent and child.4. Easy to fold up (with some elbow grease)5. Very Very easy to store away.6. White color, very nice can match just about anything.7. Somewhat easy to wash (not like the plastic walls on the Playzone - you just wipe clean), we had to take the gate into the yard and rinse it off with the water hose.8. If it is not bolted into the walls it is quick and easy to take down for more space verses other products such as the Playzone are pretty permantent once in place (they are just too big and bulky)All in all I gave the Superyard XT 4 stars because it has options to make it as sturdy as the more expensive ones out there, but the more expensive ones do not require screws, or holes to your home to complete the job. If you want to use the Superyard as an extensive gate to block entranceways this gate is fantastic in every way.

I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.  Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).  I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.  But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.  It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.  Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.  Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.  If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month.\",\n",

Lately, he has also started experimenting with the different instruments, both alone and together.  He plays with it for hours.  I don't get tired of hearing it either, because there are several different songs, and the sound quality is not irritating.  It's electronic, but much more pleasant than many of his other music toys.

I\\'m so glad I got it despite the negative reviews and it doesn\\'t bother me that the sounds aren\\'t completely authentic.  (I\\'d also like to note that the violin is the worst sounding one, the other instruments sound more like the real thing in my opinion.)  I love that you can hear each instrument\\'s part separately and choose which instruments you would like to play together.  My 1 year old likes to push the buttons to listen to the music while he plays with other toys, and often as soon as the song is over he will stop what he\\'s doing to start another song then go back to playing.  As he gets older it will be neat to show him that while each instrument plays similar but different parts, they all go together to make a pretty song.The toy seems very sturdy, although after several months of play the \\'harp\\' button has to be pushed a little harder than the others for some reason.',\n",

As she gets older, she can use the cube to learn about different kinds of sounds and about colors.  For now, though, she just likes to chew on the corners and is delighted whenever the music starts playing.I am giving this four stars instead of five because the cube is secured to its packaging with wire-like pieces of plastic that protrude from the toy.  It is actually very difficult (and maybe impossible) to remove these pieces entirely from the toy, and that presents a danger of poked eyes and scratches.  Eventually, we had to cut the plastic ties very close to the toy and then push the raw ends into the toy, where they still are (and we hope they stay there).  There seems to be no way to remove them entirely.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'There are really mixed reviews for this product, and I think this is for two reasons: 1) the fact that different people are looking to this product with very different ideas of what they think their kids will get out of it and 2) the fact that the product quality really did go downhill when Munchkin took over from Embryonics.  Let me try to help you sort out both points.Before I do, I should mention that I originally got the Munchkin version, didn\\'t like it, and ended up replacing it with the original Embryonics version, which I like much better.  My 19-month-old seemed to enjoy both versions.Before you get this product, ask yourself, \"What value do I think it will have for my child?\"  Here are a few possibilities:1) You just want some kind of musical toy with which the child can interact to change the song that\\'s playing.  If this is your thought, you will probably be happy with either version of this toy.  (Then again, if that\\'s ALL you want, you\\'d probably be just as happy with theBaby Einstein Take Along Tunestoy, which my son enjoys, and which is both cheaper and more portable.)2) You want a musical toy that\\'s a bit more interactive, where the child can change the sound of the song that\\'s on.  In this case, you\\'d also probably be happy with either version of this toy.  My 19-month-old son loves to press the buttons to turn on and off different instruments, change the song playing, and just listen to the music and dance and clap to it.  He does seem to enjoy this more than the Baby Einstein player mentioned above, perhaps because he can change things up in a greater variety of ways.3) You hope that your child will start to recognize the sound of different instruments from this toy.  If you have any thought like this in your head, banish the thought of getting this toy - you will likely be disappointed with either version of it. You will certainly be disappointed on this count if you get the Munchkin version.  On the better, original Embryonics version of this toy, the piano and harp sound reasonably true to their real sound and the flute is recognizable on the higher notes, at least.  The french horn, however, is barely recognizable as a brass instrument, and doesn\\'t have any of the beauty and timbre of sound that a real French horn does.  And the violin - forget it!  It doesn\\'t even sound like a string instrument, and I doubt a child hearing the violin part on this cube and then hearing a real violin would hear any similarity.  On the newer Munchkin version, only the piano sounds like the same family of instrument - kind of like a harpsichord, as one musically-trained reviewer has noted.  The rest of the instruments sound like synthesized crap.  (I suspect that none of this will matter to you in the least if you just want a musical toy your child can interact with in some way, and despite this shortcoming, I think most toddlers would enjoy either version of the toy just because it is plays music and does so in an interactive way. Nonetheless, in this day of tiny, inexpensive high-quality music players, I don\\'t get why they couldn\\'t make this to sound more like real instruments, and to have better sound quality overall.)4) You would like to enjoy this toy with your child, or at least not be driven crazy by it while he is playing with it. As you can tell from what I\\'ve said already, I definitely agree with other reviewers that the newer Munchkin version of this toy has much inferior sound quality than its predecessor.  Not only are the Munchkin instrument sounds largely unrecognizable, but the music overall sounds tinny, with the result that it is really grating to listen to it for any length of time.  And if your kid likes this toy as much as ours does, you will be listening to it a LOT. I think that for this reason alone, it is probably worthwhile to check the listings until you can find the older Embryonics version of the music cube.  Even if you aren\\'t especially musically inclined.  Then again, if your kid already has lots of toys that sing and make noise (mine doesn\\'t), you may have developed the ability to tune out any kind of tinny synthesizer-produced ruckus, in which case you might as well save yourself the trouble of hunting down an Embryonics cube and just get the Munchkin version.Also, it is worth noting that the newer Munchkin version is marginally better-looking, in case that matters to anyone reading this review.  On the Embryonics version, all the sides are a somewhat drab yellow, with only the edges and centers of the cube offering any variety in color, whereas the Munchkin version is more colorful - this is the version pictured in all the product photos.',\n",

She happily tapped on the large buttons to hear each instrument and stayed engaged for at least half an hour each time she played with it. Now at almost 16 months old, she has figured out how to play with it more, understanding that she can change the melody to each song and is just starting to realize with true understanding that she can add/remove an instrument to change the song to her liking. I find myself playing with this toy, as do many of my daughter's young playmates and their parents too! Some of her older cousins, who are 7-9yrs old also find enjoyment playing with this toy as well and this just proves the endless possibilities this toy provides as well as many years of extended play. So far, this toy has been dropped quite a bit and it still looks/functions as new as the day I purchased it.I'm also aware that this toy is what many have called a cheaper reproduction of the original that was out many years ago, but the product I received is pretty good too. The Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube is very engaging and while others have said the music sounds &#34;tinny&#34;, I didn't find that to be the case at all. I'm no music expert, but to my ears, each of the instrumental sounds is clear and pretty to me! I'm sure the original was really great but this one is pretty nice too. I suspect that maybe I received a newer model and the quality has been improved and if that's the case, I HIGHLY recommend the purchase of this toy. The instruments sound lovely, the songs are pleasant and will not annoy you as other toys do, and most of all, this toy is educational because it engages children to think and can be enjoyed for many, many years to come!\",\n",

I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery.

The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and, as he grew, he played with it more and more. I keep it in his playpen and it\\'s easily his favorite toy (besides his exersaucer and jumperoo). It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it\\'s easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners (so, if baby falls on it, no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on).I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there. And, with the click of the \"Orchestra\" side, the song changes.So glad I bought this!Update 6/10: My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Based on the myriad of reviews here, I purchased this toy when my triplets were several months old.  To be honest, they did not care for or notice it until they were closer to 8 or 9 months.  At that point, they realized they could start and stop the music by hitting at it.  All of a sudden, they took great interest in it.  It was also excellent when they were just learning to sit unassisted.  They could lean forward and balance on the cube while playing at the same time.Now that they have \"figured\" it out, the toy is a little less appealing.  I am waiting for the next enjoyment phase to kick in when they start noticing and playing with the different instruments.My only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that battery life is shorter than I would have expected.  While not bad, it seems to slow down more quickly than our other battery operated toys.',\n",

If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty \"unproductively\" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.

While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child\\'s butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.  Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.  Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.

I think once he gets more efficient at using the seat this will improve.  The urine guard at the front is also a separate piece just tucked in between the seat and the base, so when my son climbs on, he sometimes knocks it out of place (doesn't guard well then).  I do like that it's a bendable rubber type material so it has some give when he scooches his behind over it.  My dad had to fashion a filler block out of styrofoam attached with packing tape to the back of the seat because our toilet is oval so this potty seat slides back when my son sits down.  The description said it works with round and oval seats.  This is true - it does fit - but slides to the back of the toilet opening so my son's feet don't reach the stool and he gets scared.

This little seat seemed to fit the bill and was cheap enough that I didn\\'t mind buying another seat.Yes, it \"fits\" elongated toilets. But there is nothing to keep it from sliding around on the longer toilet seat underneath it - no clamps, no pegs, no rubber feet, nothing! Every time my daughter tried to sit down, the seat would slide 4 inches backwards - landing her on the pee guard. If I start with the little seat as far back as possible, it\\'s too far for her to get on without help (she\\'s nearly 3!) and once on, her feet don\\'t touch her fairly tall step stool. It needs to be at the front of the toilet seat but it won\\'t stay there. So I have to be with her to hold it in place so she can climb on. Not a problem if you are starting out - you need to be with your child - but this is a problem if your child knows how to use the potty and wants to express her independence and \"do it herself\".Once she is sitting with the seat in the proper place, the biggest complaint starts. This thing collects pee. The little pee guard is pointless. From what I\\'ve seen pee guards are needed by some kids, not by others - regardless of sex. My daughter needs one - a decent one. This one just deflects her pee all over the seat, the floor, her pants, her shoes. In short, a drippy, nasty mess that has to be cleaned every time it is used with extra laundry. I shudder to think of the muck that is accumulating in the foam under the vinyl.She wanted one with handles. Fine. I\\'ve added two simple drawer pull knobs to our Primo Ducka potty seat.

We were using the potty before, but I thought if we were going to train her for good, it was better to train her in the toilet.

Very sturdy and easy to clean (you can separate the cushion from the plastic, to clean separately).

       "  'reviewText': \"Purchased this at Walmart for $12.  I was under the impression that it fit more securely such as clipped on at the handles.  It just rests in the hole of the toilet seat and slides around a bit.  When lifting my daughter off of the seat, her legs stick to it, it goes up with her and then falls back onto the toilet.  She isn't scared too much by that since it is lightweight, but I would think that to be terrifying for a 23 month old just starting to use a big, scary toilet.It seems comfortable enough and my daughter was willing to sit on it for about 5 minutes straight on the first try.  Since she loves Dora so much, she really liked this potty seat, however, I can see that being a problem:  I may find the potty seat in random places throughout the house since she'll want to play with it!  Something I hadn't thought of!Being as lightweight as it is, it's easy for myself or even my daughter (once she learns how) to put it on the toilet very easily.I really do not want a separate potty seat to have to clean so was looking for something like this.Overall, serves its purpose for the low price I paid for it.In hindsight, I would have just payed double this price for the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer (29.99 with free shipping here on amazon.com!) that adjusts to fit ALL toilet seats snugly.  The reviews were raving on that one!Good luck fellow potty trainers!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This gate could have easily been 5 stars, but there are a few points that need mention, where the gate needs some improvement.  If \\'Evenflo\\' addresses these, this gate will easily merit a top score.  Let me start with the positives.  The gate itself is made of sturdy and aesthetically appealing wood.  It works well and looks great, IF the install goes well, and as EXACTLY specified (included paper template is great).  The mechanical \\'lock latch\\' inspires confidence in that you can actually feel and hear it \\'click into place\\', which gives one peace of mind.  Of course, one hopes that \\'Evenflo\\' has determined this type of latch to be one that is not \\'easily defeated\\' by the age group that it was manufactured/intended for (6 months to 2 years)!  Thankfully, it does seem like it is up to the task.  I also like the fact that the bottom latch receptacle allows for the gate to slide into, thus adding reinforcement to BOTH the top and bottom portions of this gate.  Way to go \\'Evenflo\\'!  The negatives about the gate are as follows. In many typical installations, there will be baseboard molding/trim that may get in the way of installing the bottom-most latch receptacle. It did in my case, even after carefully measuring the proper clearance from the floor, as specified in the assembly directions.  Thus, I wasn\\'t able to get the latch receptacle to clear the molding in order to screw in the bottom screw.  I had to thus cut (with a hacksaw) that portion of the latch receptacle, and \\'modify\\' it for my installation.  I then was only able to use 1 screw (although a larger and longer one than provided), instead of 2, to install the bottom latch receptacle.  Thankfully, even just the modified 1 screw installation was very tight and secure going into the door jam wood.  \\'Evenflo\\' should provide the consumer with at least another type of bottom latch receptacle that allows for better clearance of molding near the floor.  Besides, MOST typical homes DO have some kind of baseboard molding, and mine was only 1/1/2\" high, hardly anything large.  Lastly, the assembly directions did not make clear which latch receptacle to use on the top, and which on the bottom.  They are NOT the same dimensions, as one is thicker than the other (top latch receptacle is thinner than the thicker bottom one).  Of course, the aforementioned \\'latch receptacle\\' install challenge may not even apply to you for your installation, especially if you don\\'t have floor baseboard molding.  In summation, this gate is STURDY and EXCELLENT, and a good value.  PLEASE, just make sure you do install it correctly (as per the instructions), and NEVER leave your baby alone unsupervised.  These gates are meant to be used WITH proper supervision, and never as a replacement for.',\n",

Sometimes when it unlatches, it can pinch your fingers, and you have to get both the top and bottom of the gate in the correct angle, or else it won\\'t open. The same problem arises when closing. You have to make sure the two openings are aligned, or else the gate won\\'t lock properly.

       "  'reviewText': \"Update: 6-months later - the sliding mechanism has loosened up considerably with use.  It now slides smoothly without pinching our hands.  I've found the gate to be strong and secure - it has never weakened or popped out when my son tries to stand on it.  So, if you buy it, try rubbing some wax, or something, on it to help in the beginning, because it was pretty dangerous at first.  And also be aware that little hands can still get pinched in between the actual rungs when you're opening it. That will happen with any slotted, sliding gate.  Some further negatives I found is that the latch is loud, and it's also difficult for grandma to open and close because she has arthritis in her hands.  And with it being difficult for her to do, she tries repeatedly and the noise is very loud and annoying.  I'm always afraid she's going to wake the kids.  So, if you have your mom at your house a lot, get something easier.  It will save a lot of frustration - for both of you!-----I've had this installed for a little over a week and have seriously pinched my skin twice on it.  What happens is when you unlatch it, you first have to slide the gate in, then swing it out.  There are metal brackets that hold the two halves of the gate together, and in which the horizontal wooden bars slide along to extend and contract (look at the photo - you'll see what I mean).  The sliding movement is quite stiff and hard to do.  I'm sure with use it will loosen, or perhaps I can put some wax on there.  But when you're opening the gate in a rush, as I did today when we were hit with a sudden downpour and I needed to run upstairs to shut the windows, I put too much muscle into getting the darn thing to slide, and the outside of my hand got pinched beneath the metal bracket.  The first time I did this last week my older son woke up yelling for me and I wanted to get upstairs quickly before he woke the baby.  My hand got pinched under that metal part and I thought to myself that I need to be more careful. But busy parents like us don't have the time to stop and think about being careful when opening a gate.  When we've got screaming kids and rain coming through the windows, the last thing we should have to worry about is hurting ourselves on a SAFETY gate!! I dont' mean to beat a dead horse, but seriously, that's not good.  The pinch I got today was major painful - I've got a blood blister that's almost half an inch long!\",\n",

I would prefer more dinosaurs and less rocks, but oh well. It is still great. My three and a half year old loves playing with this set. The play mat is actually pretty cheap, but my son doesn't seem to care. It is made of really thin plastic and doesn't stay open all the way since it has been folded. Once you put all the dinosaurs on it, though, it stays down just fine. All the rest of the stuff is high quality and the tub is great for keeping everything together. Just for size reference, the brachiosaurus is 6 1/2 inches tall, and this is the biggest dinosaur in the set. I'm really happy with the size of all the dinosaurs. I was worried that they were going to be kind of small, but they are a perfect size.\",\n",

I don't think she could ever climb out of it, but I'm not going to chance it.We haven't had any problems with it... safety or otherwise... I started to buy the mini mastreo walker but was turned off by some of the reviews. The main reason I bought this one is, reviews on that one were mostly displeased with how hard it was to turn. This one is very easy to turn. My girl spins in circles, even on the carpet and on our wood deck!Yes, it is bulky, but have you seen a walker that's not? They have to be so that they can't be tipped over! The only problem I have with it is... there is not a volume switch. It is not too loud, but when you've had a rough day and have a nice headache to prove it - keep them away from this toy!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I love this nice, big playpen.  Lots of room to practice/learn crawling.  Lots of things to look at: primary colors and geometric shapes and things on the side to play with.  Mat wipes clean and doesn\\'t absorb fluids (pee, drool, drinks; you just wipe them up, don\\'t need to wait for mat to dry or anything).  It\\'s very sturdy and easy to put together AND the latches latch very easily.  I think it\\'s rated up to 30lbs (or when the child can climb out, of course).Potential drawbacks:-Takes up lots of floor space (worth it to me for the extra crawling room).-It has built in noise-making toys on walls: a crinkle wing butterfly & a rattle bumblebee. Neither are very loud, but still, they aren\\'t detachable & might bother some people.  It also has a louder squeaky toy built into the ladybug on one side but I don\\'t think a child could squeak it on their own; in fact my preschooler knows how and isn\\'t strong enough to compress it enough to produce a squeak.  It has to be squeezed from both sides--so maybe if the ladybug was up against a wall the child could press the ladybug into the wall and squeak it, but that\\'s easily solved by putting the ladybug facing out.-Mirror is up too high to be seen by a baby until the child can sit up on their own.-Once it\\'s assembled it\\'s not simple to move.  Apart from the four corner feet, there are four support feet (for a total of 8 feet) and no wheels on any of them. (But many of the wheeled playpens are so difficult to navigate that you don\\'t move them much either.)-It\\'s surprising how MUCH it stands out in a regular room--so big and so brightly colorful, it is not going to blend in to most adult decor AT ALL.  I think it also comes in black, though.  The black one may not have the noise-making built-ins, I\\'m not sure.None of the potential drawbacks bothered me much, but they were a bit of a surprise.  I\\'m still very happy--it\\'s easy to assemble and is one of the bigger portable playpens available.  As a bonus it comes in a large box AKA \"toy\" for other youngsters. ;-)UPDATE:  We\\'ve been using it for 6 months now and LOVE IT!  We have an always moving one year old baby.  The high walls keep him from climbing out, the extra supporting legs handle it when he jumps, falls or flops down with all his might.  The built in toys on the walls are still in great shape (I\\'m still the only one who can make the ladybug squeak).  It is just so nice to have a play pen big enough for him to actually PLAY in.',\n",

I find this shape to be less confining than the usual playpens now available that are basically the same thing as putting the baby in a bed.Playpens weren\\'t this cute back then, but every bit as handy. It is not only a perfectly safe and controlled area in which babies can learn to play and quietly make sense of their world, but it provides great peace of mind for parents and grandparents to be able to put the baby down in a safe place while talking on the phone or doing something that does not allow for hands-on and undivided supervision. This unit is well built, stable, portable, and easy to fold (once you get the hang of it, it\\'s not exactly intuitive).How could it be better? I would like the padding to be a little bit thicker, I would like the play area to be a little bit larger (so two babies could play there comfortably, like in the \"old\" days), and I would like a removable and washable cover to the pad instead of having to make my own.But, this review is based on it being the best that is available now and it living up fully to the product description.',\n",

This exceeded my expectations for a travel crib.This is the perfect balance between being spacious enough for an active tot without taking up your entire living room.  I like that it is self contained (i.e. has a base that sits above the floor) and that it has some built-in toys.  It also is very easy to fold and unfold.  We bought a Graco Travel Lite portacrib for my daughter when she was three months old for traveling with and while it was great when we could use it as a bassinet, as soon as we put her down in the crib section she HATED it (tough \"mattress\", very small - but exceptionally light &lt;20 lbs).We usually stay somewhere that has a crib, but if we took a car trip I would definitely bring this with both for sleeping and playing.I agree with the other reviewers that I wish this came with a sheet (or that Graco even made a sheet for this).  That being said, it only took me about 10 minutes to make a fitted sheet for this on my sewing machine (it looks something like a large European pillow case).',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Just got this playpen a few days ago. It is awesome! Set it up without instructions in under 2 minutes, and I'm 6 months pregnant which makes some things a challenge. It's a very nice size and fits a good deal of toys, though if the room is small it does take up a lot of space. Baby loves the bug toys on the sides. She's just learning to sit on her own and I was very pleased to see when she fell back she did not cry - the floor pad is thick and soft so it cushioned her head. I like that because she did fall backwards once in her gym (placed on the carpet) and was very upset. With this I know if she falls back she won't get hurt. It's very colorful and she really seems to enjoy her time in it. Great purchase!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"let me state at the onset that this pack n play was a little above my price range.  I was hoping to pay for something around $75 at the most.  I had a pack n play from graco with the changing table attached.  I basically have it solely for that purpose - the changing table. With the holidays coming and some overnight stays expected, I wanted one that was easy to put together and fold up and go QUICKLY.  I read numerous reviews on Amazon on several pack n plays.  I kept coming back to this one mostly b/c of the bright colors. I was basically sold when I read one review that stated a 14 year old put this together in less than a minute.  NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!  I'm a single mom and have absolutely no patience for something that is complicated.  My mom and I put the graco pack n play with the changing table together and it was very difficult. I think it took over an hour to put together with another person.  The review I read was dead on.  I took the totbloc pack n play out of the box and had it together within 2 minutes.  My 9 month old baby loves it.  it is VERY ROOMY inside.  She has not slept in it yet since I only got it today.  The bottom is fairly quilted and I don't think she will have a problem with napping in it.  She loves the bugs on the 4 sides too.  The bright colors are great.  I'm sure we will be using this for a long time.\",\n",

But I've noticed that she does get a bit overstimulated with all the pictures on the bottom and her toys actually get lost on the mat because they blend in with it.Pros: it's easy to put together and take apart, it's relatively light, it's colorful, has built in toys, and is stable.Cons: the base of the play yard slopes inward, makes it hard for my baby to crawl and flip over and all her toys roll right into the center. I sort of fixed that by putting something under the center leg. The other negatives are that it's too colorful on the bottom and has too many pictures so the toys blend in. Also, it's not PVC, phthalate free. I emailed the company and asked them about chemical fire retardants. I don't know if anyone cares, but the foam mattress IS treated with chemicals - chlorinated tris. It was banned in baby clothes by the FDA, and is banned in Europe because it's cancerous. Since the cover of it is porous and is not waterproof, I feel like the chemical can easily get in my daughter's lungs, especially since she loves to suck on fabric. So I sent the yard back. I'll be buying a Joovy, they don't use chemical fire retardants. That was actually the biggest drawback for me.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Graco Tot Block with Bugs is a pack and play that features figures of bugs on each of the sides for added fun. Kids enjoy playing with the bugs and each offers something slightly different. The bee has its two wings extended inside of the playpen and the wings make a rattling noise when moved. The butterfly's wings are also extended inside the playpen and they offer the sound of paper being crinkled. The ladybug has a squeak toy inside its body to create its own unique sound and the sun has a mirror for a child's enjoyment. Each offers its own type of stimulation and since they are built in, they are always there. There is no need to worry that the toys will be lost.Besides the toys, the other reason kid's love the Graco Tot Block with Bugs is for its bright colors. Most playpens are dark blue or dark green in color and offer nothing that is visually appealing. This pack and play, however, offers combinations of bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Babies seem more entranced with this playpen than with the plain colored playpens. They like looking at the bright colors and playing with the interactive, built- in toys on the sides of the playpen.Like other pack and plays, Graco Tot Block folds up for easy storage. You need to remove the pad from the inside before you fold the unit because the pad acts as a cover for the rest of the playpen. Once you have the playpen folded, it slips inside of the pad using Velcro straps to secure it in place. Once the pad has been wrapped, the entire unit then slips into a plastic bag with a zipper to keep it shut. This is simple enough, but I have noticed that this pack and play weighs a little more than others and it is also a little more awkward to remove and set up. It helps to have a second person to open it up and prepare it for use. But this is only a minor inconvenience because it can still be set up with little effort.With all of the stimulation offered with this playpen, there is one possible disadvantage: It could keep your child from falling asleep. If your goal for buying this playpen is strictly to have a place for your youngster to play, then the added stimulation will be an asset. But if you want to place your child in the playpen for a quick nap, you might have some difficulty due to the attention- grabbing colors and interactive toys. These toys cannot be removed from the walls of the playpen so they could definitely create a distraction that could prevent some kids from falling asleep.Graco recommends this playpen for smaller kids up to approximately two years of age. If your child is older, then you should not use this playpen because he/she might be able to climb out. Most kids age two or under, however, will be small enough to use this playpen. Also, even though there is no defined limit for the number of kids who can play inside this device, I think it should be limited to two. Any more than two and the kids will begin to get frustrated with the constant bumping into each other.Overall, this is a very good pack and play from Graco and it ranks among my child's favorite playpens. The colors and interactive, built in toys make it a favorite among all kids and while it does weigh a little more than other pack and plays and does require more effort to unpack and set up, it still makes a good choice for parents of small children. The interactive toys can't get lost and the unit's bright colors make it appealing to children and adults alike.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have three kids. The first two didn't need a playpen, but my 8 month old baby is the most adventurous yet. Everything goes into his mouth - dust bunnies, little scraps of paper my other two kids overlooked when they cleaned up after playing with paper, anything. I'm worried he will eventually find a little toy like a Squinkie, or something will fall off of a counter, and he will get it. He also pulls the kitchen chairs over on him, so we have them bungie corded to the table legs. Of course we will still give him supervised time to roam, but we needed him to have a safe place to go other than his excersaucer. Now that he crawls and cruises he is not content in his excersaucer for more than a couple of minutes. He would much rather play UNDER the excersaucer. We let him check out the playpen from the outside before we put him inside so he would be intrigued. So far he likes it. He is able to cruise in the playpen and gum the top rail. I purchased some new toys to put in it too so he will have something new to play with in there.Each of the sides has a toy on the mesh. I've checked out two of the sides. One crinkles when it is touched and another is a mirror. They seem to each have elements that are popular in baby toys.I also got another of the same playpen for my parents house. They have a dog that chews his toys (and the baby's) to bits. And their floor is not clean enough for a baby to crawl on.The playpen sets up and folds down just like the smaller Pack and Plays. It is essentially the same thing. It is a square as wide as the longest side of the Pack and Play.\",\n",

It was so simple to assemble, it took only about 3 minutes from box to being put up, and some of that time was to remove the tags.

It is great for sleeping away from home, and great for playtime, because there is enough room for baby to crawl around and sptill have plenty of room for toys in with him.  You can purchase sheets for sleeping, but you won't need extra padding or an extra mattress, it's soft enough. It's easily moved from room to room.I put a different pack N play together a few months ago from the same company and it was a nightmare!  In my opinion, this is the best on the market.\",\n",

My only gripe is if the baby were to puke on the mat there's no way to wash the entire thing, just spot clean.  To solve this problem one has to buy a covering/sheet to cover the playpen surface.  Sheets are hard to find, and expensive to purchase and ship. But on a positive note the playpen is sturdy and easy to assemble.\",\n",

The bright colors, designs, and toys caught his attention right away. When I put him in other play yards we have, he won't stay in it long and wants to come out right away, but when we put him in this play yard he is completely distracted and has fun playing in it with his other toys. There is a lot of space for him to move around and it is very sturdy.

I do not have a child but I watch my nephew very frequently (every other weekend). I wanted something that could be both a place to sleep and a place to play. With its bright colors and toys built in my nephews face turned to smiles. He is so comfortable that when he is done playing and tired he will put his head down to sleep. He loves the rattle butterfly and the crinkle butterfly. He plays with the toys on the pack n play more then the toys in the pack in play. Set up was a breeze. Before buying this pack n play we borrowed my brothers. What a pain to put together and take apart. Sometimes all the sides did not lock and you had to start all over. And take down, you prayed before you start that all the pieces snap apart and it will take you less then 20 minutes. With this pack n play it takes a minute, parts snap and unsnap quickly it is the true pack n play. The bag is a little cheaply made then other bags I've seen but fits perfectly. The padding on the bottom of the pack n play is thicker then others I have seen. It is larger then other pack n plays so you will have a hard time finding bedding and sheets that fit it properly.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I purchased this square playpen for an 8 month and 18 month old (not at the same time of course).  I have purchased a few pack n plays rectangular and a few of these square playpens.  You would think they are the same, but they are not.  The pack n plays are great for naps, (I would say 18 months and younger), and easy to transport and some come with a bassinet for babies.  I have used those strictly for naps, as they are not that stable or large enough for play.  This square playpen is ideal!!!  It is so sturdy.  Easy to set up, take down.  Perfect for when you need to get something done.  It keeps those walking and crawling confined, but still gives plenty of space for them and a few of their toys.  The 18 month child seems perfectly content playing and falling asleep in it, whereas the pack n play, he hated it.  Couldn't stand up without falling down.Gives you the much needed break so you can get things done.  Since this is for short terms during the day and I give him some toys, he doesn't mind it.  Then I put him in a portable crib for sleeping.  In my honest opinion, the square playpen is much better for him and safer than the portable crib, but foster services states you have to have a crib, not playard for sleeping.  I feel much more comfortable having the child in the playpen than the crib.He also likes the bright colors.  It is a little heavier than the pack n plays rectangular.  It is not something I would take along where I had to carry it very far.  But it does pack up the same as the pack n plays, and you could transport it to a grandparents house, or babysitter, or the park.  Just a little heavier and larger than the pack n plays.  This has been a lifesaver!!  In my opinion, works better than using those portable plastic pens.  I tried that, didn't last long.  Wouldn't go back to that, and have no problems recommending these square playpens.The ones I purchased came with a thick padded mat.  It is very substantial and seems to work fine.  However, I guess you could add padding underneath if you needed to.This is perfect if you wanted something for a grandparents house, it could be used for play or sleeping and then easily stored away taking little room.  These square ones do not have wheels, so if you needed something really portable, you might want the rectangular.  If you are using for both play and sleep, I would suggest limiting the time the child is in the pen, so they see that as more of a rest area than confinement.\",\n",

Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.

It is the standard length of a traditional playpen, but the width is the same as well which gives babies much more space to crawl around in and play than the typical playard.  It is very simple to put up and take down.  My baby has only slept in it one night and it was fine for her.  It is very sturdy and the bottom mat has tabs that snap into the base of the frame for extra stability. The colors are bright which is good for the baby but doesn't exactly fit into my home decor. The sides each have a toy- a mirror, two rattle butterflies and one squeek lady bug.  The squeek is really hard to press so I often hold my hand on one side of the pen for stability and press on the other side but that is only an extra feature so I'm not really disappointed.  This is the most affordable by far of the larger size playpens and I'm very happy with my choice.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'After our son discovered yet another non-child-friendly item on the floor of our home and hoarded it in his mouth for hours (unbeknownst to us), my wife and I decided we wanted another prison--I mean \"play yard\"--for our son to roam around in because apparently we\\'re terrible at the whole concept of baby-proofing.So I found this item on Amazon and, through my sleeplessness, thought the dimensions were 9\\' x 9\\'--sounded like a steal for $90.  We ordered this one and I was a bit dismayed when the box showed up and it turned out to be another pack n\\' play.  Like probably most other parents, we already have the obligatory pack n\\' play.  It\\'s small and cozy and our son likes it fine.  I told my wife and she was more than a bit dismayed: another pack n\\' play she did not want.  (She also wondered how I thought the dimensions were 9\\' by 9\\', but that\\'s another story.)Well, we could have returned it with the free returns, but after we got it set up and plopped our son it in, we were hooked and so was he.  Here\\'s why it\\'s ten times better than your average pack n\\' play:1.  The colors are so vibrant--reds, blue, green, yellow--as opposed to the muted colors you often see on a pack n\\' play.2.  Each wall of the pack n\\' play has a different feature: for instance, one wall has a ladybug that squeaks; another has a butterfly that moves and rustles; another has a bee that also moves and rustles; and another has a sun with a mirror on it.  Although the mirror is not the fanciest mirror I\\'ve ever seen, it keeps our budding narcissist fascinated for minutes at a time.3.  It\\'s sturdier than any pack n\\' play I\\'ve seen, and the walls don\\'t budge when he stands up in it, but it\\'s also squishy enough to withstand falls.  I\\'ve seen my son fall plenty of times inside of it, and he hasn\\'t seemed bothered.  Perhaps he caught his reflection on the way down.4.  Though not 9\\' x 9\\', it\\'s bigger than any pack n\\' play I\\'ve ever seen.  (Note: I\\'ve heard this can cause problems if you\\'re using it for sleep, because it can be harder to find sheets that fit, though apparently you can find people who make special square sheets instead of the standard rectangular sheets.)5.  Our son actually likes going in there, unlike his other pack n\\' play (or--god forbid--his North States Superyard play yard--you\\'d think we\\'d sent him to Guantanamo Bay).Overall, it really just looks like a fun, happy, and bright place to be in, and it\\'s well made and looks like it will last for a while, and perhaps most importantly, our son doesn\\'t fuss when we put him in there, and, to state the obvious, putting him in there keeps him away from the unmentionable hazards on the floors of our home.  So although I don\\'t think you need TWO pack n\\' plays, I\\'m not too sad that I made the reading error and ordered this one by mistake, because this particular pack n\\' play is awesome.To sum it up, if you\\'re going to buy one pack \\'n play, buy this one, because it\\'s the clear winner.',\n",

My son is primarily breastfed, but my wife and I supplement his breastfeedings with pumped breastmilk and with formula.  The Original Nursers are made from polypropylene, which is a BPA-free plastic.  The liners are also BPA-free although I'm not sure what kind of plastic they are manufactured from.  Unlike some other corporations in the baby products industry, Playtex Baby is serious about customer support.  I have called the customer service number several times now and have gotten to talk to a knowledgeable person in every instance.  If you want to experiment with these bottles to see if they will work for you, I would suggest that you stop in at Target or Walmart.  They sell trial bottles for under $4 that come with either a latex or silicone nipple and 5 drop-in liners.  Unfortunately, the trial bottles that come with silicone nipples are the premium nursers, which are made from polycarbonate, a non-BPA-free plastic (this isn't necessarily a deal breaker for me because the milk never comes into contact with the polycarbonate).\",\n",

I pumped my milk so dad could feed her when I was at work or college.  NEVER had any problem between bottlefeeding and breastfeeding - no nipple confusion, etc.  Gas wasn't a big problem either. They are so easy to clean - no scrubbing the bottle just drop in liners. Just have to clean the base/nipple/ring, but super easy and used to throw in the dishwasher.  Easy to store breastmilk in liners or bags and just pop them in the bottle after thawing. After 7 years could have still used my same bottles but opted to buy new ones because they were not BPA free.I also bought some AVENT bottles this time around - because that is the brand of pump I bought - and they are pretty good too.

The ones we chose to try were:-Dr. Brown\\'s BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle-Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Bottles- ThesePlaytex, although in concept very appealing, we did not like because due to their design/material it is hard to get out all of the milk and so some of it always gets wasted.  Also, it is very challenging to measure out exact amounts as the numbers and gradations on the dropins is hard to see.  We stopped using these very quickly.  Although, if you are using formula that is less viscous than milk, these might be work much better.  Plus, Target sells a store version of dropins which a lot of people like, so that helps a lot with the price.Avent bottles are generally very good, and we ended up using them a lot.  Also, we purchased the ridiculesly overpricedPhilips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kitto be able to use the bottles withMedela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump.  The setup works great.  The main problem with the Avent bottles is that if you forget to put in the little ring, the milk will leak all over your child. With the ring in, we never had a leak. We have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples N-4, and the above comments apply to all variations.Dr. Brown\\'s bottles are probably the best out of the three.  Like the Avent, we have used both the larger and smaller bottles and nipples 1-4.  With its design, it is harder to assemble the bottle without all the necessary pieces.  We have never had these bottles leak.  The complaints that they are hard to wash are unfounded.  We never had an issue with just throwing them in the dishwasher.  After about nine months of use, some of the markings are slightly coming off, not a big deal.  Also, the number of parts (6 vs Avent\\'s 5 counting the lid) is not as overwhelming as some people on here claim.There seem to be no difference in any of the above bottles when it came to reducing gas.  All of them reduced some, but not all.  Likewise, our son had no preference in the nipples from one bottle to the next among these, although he absolutely hatedThe First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, so we only tried it once.If I had to pick only one of the above brands, it would be Dr. Brown\\'s.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This particular starter set of Playtex Drop-Ins is a great place to start if you\\'re looking for an economical way to sample a wide variety of nipple types and the Drop-Ins system as a whole. We did not need to purchase additional Drop-In bottles because of the quick and easy clean-up, although we did purchase extra nipples of the type our daughter preferred. We have used both the Playtex VentAire and Playtex Drop-In bottles for the past year as we switched between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with my daughter, who has just reached her first birthday. Of the two, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding, although neither has caused the dreaded \"nipple confusion.\" In both cases, we use the slow flow variety of nipple for each bottle type. This is how the two compare:1. The Drop-Ins win hands-down for convenient clean-up and are thus our favorite to travel with. Throw out the old liner, pop in a new one, fill it up, and you\\'re ready to go - easy to do even in the backseat of a car with a crying baby. No bottle brush or hot, soapy water needed.2. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which we have found is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).3. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle with a slow flow nipple can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle with a slow flow nipple leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). This is less of an issue if there will be parental supervision.4. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider, and if she falls asleep, the bottle is dropped and leaks wherever it lands.Both the Playtex Drop-In and Playtex VentAire bottles are nice sets, and we have appreciated having both types to choose from to enjoy the perks of both. For convenience and fast clean-up, the Playtex Drop-In system wins. For fewer leaks and more baby autonomy, the Playtex VentAire bottles get our vote.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Several weeks ago I left a 2 star review for these bottles due to the cost of always having to buy liners with twins...as you can see I have since changed my mind and deleted that review. Why? To avoid buying more liners and since my girls are now 13 months old, we bought some other bottles that don't use a liner. After having used ONLY Playtex Drop Ins for the 1st year and then using other types of bottles for around a month I am realizing how much not only myself but my girls LOVED the Playtex Drop Ins.The Playtex Nipples are definately what my girls prefer and are much easier for them. They normally finish their night time bottles but have not been finishing them since switching to different bottles. Also the new bottles have tons of air bubbles where the Playtex did NOT.The nipple size is also good for Preemie babies. When my girls were born they were too small to suckle on the breast and most bottles were too big for their tiny mouths. I do remember when my girls were under a month old we had some Advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone had given us and I tried giving them to my girls once(the more bottles the merrier) but my girls HATED the nipples and they just seemed to big for their small mouths. I had to empty the Advent and pour them into the Playtex.And when I first wrote my 2 star review of these bottles because I hated the repeated cost of buying liners, that was also before I realized just how FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL it is to be able to throw away the liner. Since we've bought these new bottles it seems all I ever do is wash bottles...and there have been MANY times when I forget I leave a bottle that had milk in the diaper bag or some other place and GROSS, what a stinky mess. Then I actually have to soak the bottles in bleach water to make sure they are clean. With the Playtex you simply throw away the stinky liner.So I am sorry Playtex Drop Ins that I ever doubted you & gave you a 2 star review. I guess this past month of Never-Ending Bottle washing & bleaching bottles has been my lesson learned. NEVER AGAIN will I use any other bottle besides Playtex Drop Ins. Except for water or juice, cheap bottles are fine for that.So save yourself time & money and just buy the Playtex Drop Ins ESPECIALLY if you have twins. It might cost more in liners but you'll be Thankful in the long run. My girls like the Playtex Latex nipples the best.You can buy store brand liners, we've used Walmart store brand and they work fine but Playtex are definately the best liner. Keep an eye out because the Playtex liners DO go on sale and then you can stock up. Make sure you have plenty on hand so you don't get stuck in the middle of the night w/out any liners. I also liked the bags but we only used them at first when I was pumping breast milk for my girls. You can use different brands of bags for these as well.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"These bottles are fantastic in reducing gas.  My 5 week old has been using them since he was 1 week old and he has much less gas and spitting up when we use them as opposed to some other brands that we have tried.  I know these bottles have been around for a long time and now I understand why..they work.  I have found most of the new modern bottles to be all gimic and no substance.  The down side to these bottles is that you have to continually buy the bags which can get pricy.  It is also a little harder to travel with them because you have to bring the bottle, the bag, the water, and the formula all separate.  Futhermore, they don't come with caps for the nipples so you have to put your finger on the nipple to shake the formula and bag the nipple to travel with it.  I would tell anyone if they have been using Dr. Brown's, Avent, or any of the other super fancy feeding systems and their kids are still having problems with gas and spitting up, they should try these.\",\n",

The warmer is a bit of a crap shoot as far as the bottle temperatures... but it's never under-heated a bottle. At worst some bottles come out too hot. That's easily  remedied by running the bottles under cool water for a minute or two. Also - when I first got the bottles I would heat my plastic bottles in there. They seemed fine and didn't melt but I quickly switched to using only glass bottles in the warmer. It just doesn't seem right to be heating plastic on a heat source!Now the only down side to this is the cooler. It does keep things cool - but it's not impressive. It will keep things cool for up to 8 hours - but don't mistake this for being refrigerated cool. My medela breast pump tote came with a better ice pack - and that's what we're using to keep the bottles cold at night. One other trick... keep the cooler portion away from the heating portion if you want things to stay cool all night. If you keep it on the unit your bottles will warm up.All in all - this is definitely a good purchase and I'm not sorry I bought this.\",\n",

You freeze the ice pack and when you're ready to head to bed, you just bring the ice pack and two bottles, place them in the cooler and fill the two measuring water holders and slide them on the side. When your baby wakes up take the water holder off the side and pour into the warmer, place the bottle and then press the button in front to warm. While you're changing your baby the bottle will warm up and be ready by the time you're done.It takes practice, at first you'll probably either overfill the water holder or not fill it enough. For a 4oz warm  Dr Browns bottle we usually filled it to the 6 line, 2 months later we're filling it to the 7 line. 5oz bottles vary between the 7-8 line.  It seems this warmer gets weaker with use and requires more water. You also have to be careful not to spill formula/bm on the warmer or it will get sticky and won't warm the bottle as well. Oh and if you move the bottle more towards the front of the warmer it will warm up quicker.If you put too much water, the bottle will be too hot so if you're not sure start out with the 5-6 line and go from there.There is no nightlight and they shouldn't list it as a feature, the 'nightlight' is the button that glows orange when you press it to warm a bottle. It shuts off after a couple of minutes when the bottle is done.I love this thing because it makes night time feedings almost a breeze but it does have it's quirks.

When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown\\'s) will overflow.

We have been using this with ourDr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcherand it was a life saver for awhile. Now All i can smell on our bottles is burnt milk from the heating plate.... Now I am not quite sure how the milk could possibly be getting onto it but it does apparently. We have been using it for about 3 months now almost every day, four- five times a day a most and it has considerably started to take longer and longer to heat up.. Before it was done and cooled off by the time the diaper change was over. Now we find ourselves sitting and waiting another minute or two for it to finish. The instructions are basically nonexistent. All in all it still works but I can slowly start to see it go down hill in its heating capabilities.\",\n",

We loved it for the first month we had it.  BUT, after just about a month of use (warming 3 or 4 bottles per day) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top.  I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer.  (The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I couldn't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes.) We played with the amount of water we were using, thinking we were putting too much in (even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions).  That didn't help.  After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed.  I would not recommend gettin this product.  First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works.\",\n",

The gate has stood-up to our abuse, the elements (having been outdoors since first acquired), and the dismantling and ressembly due to a move.We've never had a problem opening or closing the gate and find the opening more than adequate.  My larger friends due as well.We did buy another Hearthgate to section off our family room from the rest of the house and yes, the mounting screws are coming out of the walls.  but, I'd like to preface, that is because I didn't use drywall mounts to attach the gate to the walls. I desperately needed a gate ASAP since our new house had a narrow, metal spiral staircase with a gate which didn!t latch( yes, we immediately rectified our spiral staircase gate sitch and now have a key lock on it!)..  So As soon as I got the gate home, I installed it.  After almost two years of dogs nosing it, kids hanging on it, people pushing on it, the screws are finally beginning to come out of the wall.  Tomorrow, I'm headed to the hardware store for some drywall mounts.After all the gates we've been through, I still think this gate is the best.  Installation for both gates was a breeze.Customer service was great as well.  I installed it while kids were napping.  I had to call the company after We received the wrong extension piece( wrong gate piece in extension piece's box)Oh, FYI: even after all these years, our original hearthgate doesn't show any signs of rust.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me, but I was wrong!  First, the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful.  If you're a little too forceful, it can easily break.  And if it breaks, you're out of luck with installing this gate.  Second, the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position, at the top of every fence panel.  The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture, which is in the middle of the panel!  This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location.  Third, this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced.  Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up.  If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate, I'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate.  I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels (12 feet) and it did not have any of the problems I just described.  It was expensive, but cost less than the Kidco.  Overall, it is sturdier and better made too.  The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco.  North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it isn't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too.\",\n",

We didn\\'t buy it for music, anyway.  We wanted white noise to soothe her and block out other noises.We always use the voice-activated mode, and when we first put her down, we just go \"shh\" into it or snap fingers to start it, when it begins to play for about 15 minutes, and then whenever she cries.  It does take a pretty decent sound from her to set it off, but that\\'s okay -- her softer noises are usually in her sleep anyway.  She only sets it off a couple of times a night -- I think!The biggest drawback is batteries.  Despite only using it on voice activate mode, when it\\'s only on for 15 minutes at a time, we seem to have to change batteries about every two weeks.  We switched to rechargeables, and they seem to die even sooner -- but at least we can recharge them.  The unit runs through batteries even quicker if you use the night light -- even for only a few seconds to check on the baby.

We purchased this and are delighted.  It assembled in under 10 minutes, which is unusual since most baby items take several people and loads of patience to figure out complicated directions.  This crib is light weight yet sturdy, nicely compliments any room, and is comfortable for our daughter for either sleep or play. It handles easily and can roll between doorways with no problem.  We gave it only three stars because I felt the metal bars were spaced too far apart and are not baby-friendly since the standard portable crib bedding doesn't come up high enough to protect little heads from getting bumped.  Our child already hit her head twice and the bedding did nothing to cushion the blow.  All in all it's a fine item and priced well.  We'll get better use out of it when the second baby comes since we don't have lots of space to fit another full size crib.\",\n",

I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).  They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.

The spare parts were safe at home, and with a hungry boy on my hands I was in a predicament.  Unable to nurse, I have provided my son with breastmilk by pumping three times a day since birth.  I was concerned about maintaining my milk supply, not to mention the discomfort of very full breasts, so I purchased the Isis Breastpump because I use Avent products and like the idea of being able to pump right into the feeding bottle, 4 oz, 9 oz or disposable. I am amazed by the comfort, control and power this little hand pump provides.  In addition, I enjoy the convenience of not having to be \"plugged in\" and the reduced amount of bottles to wash.  I found this pump to be great in a pinch, or for a weekend away.  However, for my particular situation having to express 30 ounces a day in order to keep up with my little guy, the Pump In Style is superior to the Isis both in speed and quantity of milk expressed.',\n",

Plus, once your milk really start to come in and your baby has been breast feeding for a few months, the milk really flows.  It wasn't especially useful for the first few months because expressing was just not feasible yet without a hospital grade pump.  Now that it is, I love this pump.  It doesn't hurt my nipples, and the small breast milk storage containers fit right on the pump.  My daughter still only drinks about 3-4 ounces at a time so I mainly use those.  I bought the disposable one because it came with the storage bags and the bottle to hold them.  I thought they would be useful for when I need to have more than 4 ounces.  The bags hold 7 and are very easy to thaw.  This breast pump is definitely worth the money.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I have been breastfeeding my son, since he was born, and now he is 9 months old. I couldn't have done it without this Avent pump. As a first time mother, I always knew I wanted to breastfeed my child, but it was a lot harder for me than I thought it would be. My son had trouble latching on in the hospital, and so, until he could breastfeed consistently (I went to a lactation consultant and she worked wonders), I was pumping my breast milk for him. At the hospital, they provided me with a Medela manual pump. It was PAINFUL. I eventually got calluses from pumping with the Medela pump. So then I was considering whether to buy the Medela electric or the Avent Isis, and I went for the Avent, a much more economical buy. This pump is so comfortable, it really imitates the suckling action of the baby. At first, all the parts might seem overwhelming, but when you put the pump together, it's a breeze and washes easily. I chose the disposable system because I thought it would be more convenient if I traveled to take the pump, however, I find I use the reusable 4 oz bottles a lot more frequently. Whether you're taking the pump on vacation,to work, to extract milk for an occasional bottle or to mix for cereal, this pump is a great buy. Now that my son is older, it is harder for me to pump so much milk (the let-down takes a little longer, and he drinks less, so I do have to pump a bit), but it's so convenient if you have to go out and run an errand, or freeze your milk so that you'll always have supply on hand for the babysitter.\",\n",

It's probably the first amazon purchase, after a couple hundred, that really left me disappointed. You're better off putting a thick, soft blanket under your baby's crib sheet if padding is what you're going for. As a mattress protector, it might be good. As a quilted pad to make it softer- it's useless. The packaging it came in is less than 1.5 inches thick if that gives you any indication as to how thin the entire thing can be folded up to. My 7 month old wouldn't have even noticed a difference. He naps SO well on our Tempurpedic with a down topper that I wanted to get him a little something to soften his mattress with now that he's older. Guess I'll have to keep looking.\",\n",

I even tried it out by placing my son's mattress on the floor and lying on it myself, his mattress still feels hard as a rock!

So far it has held up in the wash, but mind you I wash it on cold and dry it on extra low. My son is just over 4 months old and I don't have any worries about SIDS because of this product.

After trying all others once again with my daughter I decided to use these. When I went to buy new nipples I noticed they looked different. Oh, wow, what a diffrence. Baby is 4 months old and no leaks. The new nipples have a raised edge that guarantees the nipple is tight in the collar. Then there is a lip that hugs the rim of the bottle to guard against leaks. The REALLY great thing is you can tighten these bottle to your hearts content. I tightened it as tight as I could and it didn\\'t leak a bit. The new nipples have the words \"Extra Soft\" on the package and if you look closely they look different around the bottom. I am extremely satisfied with these bottles now and will use them untill baby is weaned.',\n",

When I stopped breast feeding I tried a couple different types of bottles and eventually ended up sticking with Dr. Brown's because they helped the most with his gas and spit up. After 3 months of washing all of the parts that Dr. Brown's bottles have, I decided to try Avent. I like the bottles, they are made of a good quality material and they are wide, which made it really easy for me to mix formula in them. My son didn't have a problem latching on or anything, and his gas didn't get any worse, but his spit up became out of control!!!! He began spitting up twice as much as he did on the Dr. Brown's bottles. I was forced to switch back to Dr. Brown's because I just couldn't handle changing his clothes and mine 5 times a day.

       "  'reviewText': \"After trying Dr. Brown's, Playtex, and even the cheap bottles, Avent bottles have come to my rescue.  First of all, they have many different flows with their nipples, which is a huge plus in my book.  The Playtex have 3 - slow, fast, and tri-cut.  Avent has newborn stage 1, stage 2 (slow), medium (+3 months), and fast (+6 months), plus a tri-cut.  I have NEVER had a problem with the nipples clogging, even after putting them in the dishwasher a few times (I had this problem with all other nipples).My 3 month old daughter can finish a 6 oz bottle in 10 minutes instead of the 45 it took with the other bottles.  Also, I have never ever had a problem with leaking, I think many other moms who do are probably not reading the directions or using common sense.  If you tighten ANY bottle too tight, it will leak.  And the nipple has a special seal that you can hear when you turn it, so that will prevent leaking.There's no extra parts to wash like Dr. Browns, and they do not give my daughter gas.  In fact, my daughter will burp better now than with her other bottles.  She also prefers the wide-mouth shape and I know it gives her mouth the needed motion to widen her palatte (which is one of the reasons breastfeeding is recommended.)  We ended up selling all the other ones to our local baby consignment shop and spent the money on more Avent bottles.\",\n",

The fact that the nipples were to more mimic the breast than others was great and the fact that you could use the bottles as storage containers when pumping was even better.  When I first had my daughter, we had to put her on a bottle a week after she was here to help me have time to heal.  She was getting one bottle a day and was having no problem going back and forth from breast to bottle regularly.  The nipples are great because they force the baby to suck on them as if they were the breast.

I have 8 of them! The nipples can be a little pricey at times but check out the stores and babies rus - they're on sale at different times in the year and you can save about 15-20% on them. I wouldn't use anything else.  Target puts them on sale as well.  The silicone nipples are so much nicer than the rubber ones on regular bottles, and if you nurse and use bottles as a supplement, these are the more like yourself so the baby has an easier taking it.  The bottles withstand hundreds of washings in a dishwasher without the markings being washed off.  By far, the best bottle on the market in my humble opinion.  I received one in a gift set and my husband immediately ran out and bought a week's worth - they're just so much easier to use and they fit so well on the fridge shelves, plus those huge plastic caps that fit over the nipples are easy to remove and makes you feel like everything is cleaner.

I used the narrow necked bottles previously and I was forever spilling formula trying to put the formula in with the scoops.  The Avent bottles are also very comfortable for me to hold and easy for my baby to grip on to as well.They suit us perfectly - give them a try and see what you think.\",\n",

POUR out all over the floor, and if it is breast milk that is gushing out of the bottle you may just be crying too!I ended up with a full set of these bottles (without the ring) and one that required the ring (which I felt leaked less), I could never justify going out and buy all new bottles, so I dealt with these for 11 months. I have now weaned my son off of these and onto a sippy cup because I just could not deal any longer!What's the trick? Well, the nipple has these three little lines on it and inside the screw on part there are solid parts and slotted parts (sorry if this doesn't make sense). You have to line up the lines on the nipple with the solid parts on the bottle top. This requires two hands, so you will also need to find a place to put down your screaming baby while you concentrate and get it all lined up perfectly. Once you have them lined up, now screw on the top. You have to make sure it is nice and tight. Now, shake it and see.... it leaks! It is because when you screw the top onto the bottle the nipple shifts and turns as you screw it on tight, so all that time you spent lining up the holes with the slots is garbage. Take it off and try again. Finally you will get it right and only then can you give the bottle to your starving child.I cannot wait to throw them all in the trash.\",\n",

After trying for awhile, I finally called Avent and they told me to move up to a different size nipple.  These bottles worked out relatively well after that dilemma.

The one slight annoyance with the system, you have to place the ring on the lids directly on top of the nipples; otherwise the bottle has a tendency to leak.F.Y.I. - I purchased the adjustable flow nipples when my son turned three months old as recommended, but nowhere in the product information does it tell you that you are supposed to line-up the Roman numerals of the nipples directly in line with your baby's nose to adjust the flow.

Not a good thing because formula stains and then you have to change baby and you in the middle of the night (and pretreat clothes and wash them if you didnt want to end up replacing them).I decided to try these after seeing an add in a magazine.  THESE WORKED WONDERFULLY! No more buying and changing liners (which by the way would always break even if i was being VERY careful when i \"burped\" the bottle...its hard enough to burp baby without trying to BURP a bottle!  I never had to burp my avent bottles.  They never leaked for me.  And I rarely had to change the nipple which hold up very well to repeated dishwashings! If you think about it these really are cheaper then playtex nursers as you dont have to buy the liners and worry about them breaking and getting formula all over yourself in the mall and then having no formula and having to leave anyways...',\n",

The nipple on Avent bottles are larger at the base and firmer than the Brown bottles.  When we first introduced the bottle to our breast fed boy he did not take to the Avent bottles.  He just couldn't get comfortable around the nipple.  We switched to Dr. Bown's and he took to it with little problem.  As he got older and bigger we later switched and are currently using the Avents.  Why did we switch?  Cleaning Dr. Brown's bottles SUCKS!  There are so many little parts that all need special brushes to clean with that it takes forever to wash bottles.  Plus, the Brown bottles are thinner but taller and just don't seem to pack away as well.  However, if your baby is picky there isn't much you can do.  For expecting parents, I would not recommend buying a bunch of one type over the other.  Buy one of each first and see which one you baby is comfortable with.\",\n",

Then you are faced with the leaking problem. The directions say to wet the rim to prevent leaking. Well, sometimes that works and sometimes it dosen't. Again, I am reminded of how delicate every drop of milk was. Sometimes these bottles will taunt you. I would test the bottle before giving it to baby... then after I was convinced it wouldn't leak... baby would begin to suck and would instantly be drownded!

       "  'reviewText': 'This brand of bottles was recommended to me by a certified lactation specialist when I was having trouble with low breastmilk supply and was forced to supplement.  It was extremely important to me to be able to still feed my baby by breast and I was afraid that introducing a bottle to my daughter would cause her to lose interest in me.  I was told that this brand of bottles was created to closely imitate the breast and this is the only brand that you can easily switch baby back and forth from breast to bottle.  And it has worked wonderfully--my baby girl will feed from both without any problem.  I love the shape of the bottles--very comfortable to hold--and they are extremely easy to clean.  Out of the four 4 oz size bottles I own, one of them has a leaking problem, but I can usually solve it by loosening or tightening the cap.  My daughter has no problem sucking from the nipple, as one person reported.  These bottles are great!',\n",

Otherwise, they are perfect.  We were told that there may be &quot;nipple confusion&quot; if a baby goes from back and forth from breast to bottle but we haven't had a problem whatsoever.  These nipples are enough like the breast that he does just fine.  (His mouth is open wider than other bottles because he puts the whole nipple in his mouth, like the breast.)  I also use (and love) the Avent breast pump so you can pump right into the bottle and attach a nipple.  It couldn't be easier.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"When my daughter was born we stocked up on these bottles because we heard they were good and the price alone would make you think that. Well after using them for about 2 weeks they started to leak. NOT fun at 3:00 in the morning when you shake up a bottle and there is milk fling around.Even worse is when you are feeding and the milk pours out on baby's face. Not only do you have to clean up but your baby doesn't want to wait for a new bottle. After slowly running out of bottles that didn't leak we decided to go with the Playtex Nursers and liners.These work perfect! They don't leak and our baby has less gas. The liners prevent a lot of gas. If you are worried about the cost of liners Target has their own brand that is about half the price. You get 100 of them for maybe $5.00. We haven't had any problems with leaking at all.So I don't recommend the Avent bottles unless you want to be cleaning up milk all the time. But the other Avent things we have like the sterilizer, warmer, & many other products work just perfectly and would recommend all of them! So if you want to give these bottles a try because they do get some great reviews then just buy a few at first.We had no luck with the avent bottles but that doesn't mean they are all bad. I just had to give a warning so you don't lose a lot of money like we did.\",\n",

I asked a lactation consultant what kind of pump she'd recommend and she recommended Avent and Medela. I needed a pump in my price range so I chose the Avent.I like how the suction mimics a baby's latch but milk gets stuck everywhere and it leaks all over the place. The pump also makes an annoying squeaking noise and sometimes I lose suction. I'd recommend this pump over Gerber though. I will give it credit though, it's a lot easier to take apart and clean.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I am sold on the Avent Isis Breast Pump--it works great for me.  I nursed my 2nd child exclusively for 13 months, and I used this pump to express milk so that my husband could feed him.  He never really took on the bottle, but that's a different story.  Anyway, I just couldn't justify having to spend a couple of hundred dollars for a pump--maybe if I was working and wanted to continue breastfeeding, I probably would have.  But I was a stay at home mom and just used the pump to express every now and then.  I had no problem expressing 4 ounces of milk in about 10 minutes, and it didn't hurt either--it actually felt comfortable.  I had the Evenflo electric pump for my first child--now that one was very uncomfortable--it felt like it was sucking the life out of you.  Maybe it was me being a first time mom, but I swore off that pump.  I still nursed my first child for 13 months but not exclusively--he got both breastmilk and formula.Now, I am on my 3rd child.  I figured after having such an easy time breastfeeding my 2nd child, it would be a piece of cake the 3rd time around.  Well, it wasn't.  She did not latched on properly and I got really sore within the first couple of days.  But I did not want to give up breastfeeding, so I purchased another one of the Avent Isis Breast Pump, because I wanted to help increase my milk supply.  It worked and I got to breastfeed again exclusively--my baby wasn't getting frustrated anymore because my milk supply increased.  Then when she was 6 weeks old, I had to leave her (unexpectedly) to attend my father's funeral in California.  I couldn't take her with me--she was too young.  I was gone for 3 days, and I did not want my milk supply to dwindle down, so this pump helped a lot.  I was able to express some before I left so she would have some breastmilk along with formula supplement while I was gone.  And then I pumped while I was gone--I did it on the plane restroom and airport restrooms very discretely, and I was done in about 15 minutes at a time.  And because it is manual, I was able to express whenever and whereever I needed to.  This helped me  keep my milk supply while I was gone so when I got back, I just continued on like I was not gone.  Thanks Avent.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"With an adventurous and slightly clumsy baby, these have gone a long way towards avoiding bruises and bumps while she learns to walk and run. The ability to cut the padding and included double sided sticking tape with scissors make it easy to pad sharp furniture edges of all lengths. However there are a couple of things we have found that help us optimize its usage.  We learned to make sure the ends of any piece were very well stuck down and didn't jut out otherwise our baby would pick at them and start peeling off the padding - to avoid this, it helped to put double-sided tape all the way to the end of the piece on both inner edges.  Also we didn't use the precut edges because we found that our baby managed to rip them off pretty easily and then tried to eat the backing tape.Just be aware that if your baby is teething, the spongy texture of the padding makes it tempting for them to bite on.  I'm not 100% comfortable with that as it is fire retardant-treated despite being labeled non-latex and non-toxic.  For now I just wipe them down several times with hot water and dry well or try to put other more tempting teethers within reach.\",\n",

So i improvised. We measured the foam and cut accordingly to make it a tight fit. we then attached the corner pieces to the cut out parts using gorilla glue and then clear packing tape to re-enforece the hold. finally we put it on the table, it has just enough give to put on and off but not enough that LO will pull it off easily and huge plus for us...no damage to our pottery barn table! once i get so me photos i will attach but for the moment it is serving its purpose and we are very happy! another plus we had about 6 inches left over that we used to cover our desk pull out keyboard thing. can't beat that.\",\n",

Mine came with a 3M tape, and the installation seems very sticky. They are certainly installed firmly enough that my toddler daughter will not be able to pull them off, and that was the whole point. The only reasons I knocked off a couple stars are:1. The installation tape comes in pre-cut strips, so you have to use several of them. It would have been better if they sent a roll of the double sided tape instead. If the tape was in one roll, that would also make installation of the foam strip easier because you could put one piece of tape on the foam, and just pull the backing away from the two ends to get it aligned properly before pulling off the rest of the backing and securing the middle of the strip to the table.2. The foam strip develops something of a shape memory from being rolled up in the package, and by the time you get to the center of the roll, you really have to fight against that curved shaped to install the tape and get the strip installed on the table in a straight manner. It would have been better if it came in strips (perhaps two 6-foot strips or four 3-foot strips), but I do realize this would have also increased the shipping cost.3. There were no directions included. I am sure there must have been some things that would have made installation easier, but they included no directions other than simple pictures showing to put the tape on the foam and stick the foam on the table.',\n",

That was a HUGE mistake. Comparing this set to the one I bought, it wins in every category. It contains more than twice as much foam - PLUS corners, you can cut it to whatever size you need, it bends around curves, and It's MUCH softer than the Safety First bumper!I love it, and it's perfect. It STICKS! It's 3m brand double-sided tape and it didn't budge! I suspect people who said it doesn't stick did not clean/dry the surface properly, touched the tape too much, or maybe had a textured surface.

       "  'reviewText': \"I bought this for multiple purposes and it worked perfectly for all. The only con is that it is a bit pricey.  Overall, definitely worth the price.-Corner pieces used separately on corners of tables without the longer strips:  This doesn't look great but compared to the other clear plastic or silicone corner pieces I have much greater piece of mind with these.  They are soft enough that when my 18 month old hits his head directly on the corner he doesn't even flinch.-Long strips both with and without the corners used on table edges and on my bottom step:  I have a ledge/stoop inside my house near the backdoor and it has sharp metal edges nailed in along the entire length.  It makes a bend so I needed these strips to stick to metal on a step and not come off when we hit the edges or my son slides down on his rear.  This works like a charm.The edges have not peeled off metal, it was extremely easy to install and there was more than enough tape strips/squares given.  The double stick tape makes application quick and easy.I would highly recommend this product.*FOR A CHEAPER but not so pretty ALTERNATIVE:  Head to your local home improvement store and get pipe covers/insulation which are foam and come in varied sizes.  THey have a precut slit down the length so you can open it up and slide it on the edges of tables.  You'd need to tape it somehow but each strip is long and costs less than a dollar.  I covered a large coffee table for around $3 and some blue painters tape.\",\n",

But once on it wont come off easily even by a prying little hand it take quite a effort.If you use the adhesive on the edge of the guard that makes sure kids cant take of easily. It become furniture. I bought two of this in light and dark for different furniture when my kid was 7-8 months old.And i can vouch that this tape has avoided a handfull of accidents.CautionThe paint(especially wall paint) can come off when removing it.Once off any surface it doest stick again.Apply after you kids go to sleep needs some time to have a firm fix and so that they dont know it can be taken off.Also would add taht applying this when the child is young gives better chances that they stay on.Also Matching color should help being noted by children But you know all kids are different ;)',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The Cooshie Booster is a good booster seat for toddlers when used in the right conditions.  However, my wife and I are yet to experience the miraculous calming effects at the dinner table that so many other reviews have mentioned.The Booster is made from one solid piece soft foam material.  The material is very lightweight and cleans up very easily.  The one-piece construction also aids in clean-up - no cracks to trap food or let spills get through to your furniture.  Plus, the material grips on wooden chairs;  it's never budged when our active two-year-old is using it.  This ease of use, both at the table and when getting washed in the sink, are its major selling points.On the other hand, the one-piece construction makes the bulky Booster less than ideal for use away from home.  Forget about using it at restaurants because it's not different enough from what they'll provide.  We only take ours out when we're going to Grandma and Grandpa's house for a few days;  otherwise, it's more trouble than it's worth.  Sure, it's lightweight, but the supplied carrying case is roughly the size of a bowling ball bag.  Plus, the bag is very cheap and unattractive;  basically they're selling you the packaging as a carrying case.Lastly, we haven't seen the Booster effect any great improvement in our son's attention span at the table - when he wants to get down, he wants to get down, period.  I don't believe that any booster seat could make such a difference in toddler behavior, so I don't hold it against this one;  I'm just surprised how many others have reported these results.  If anything, our son is frustrated by the Booster because its size prevents him from climbing into his chair unassisted.  Because he's in the toddler independence phase, he'd often rather climb into another chair by himself rather than be lifted into the Booster.So, the Booster does a great job of providing a simple-to-use and easy-to-maintain solution at home, but if you take your little one out frequently, a more portable options would suit you better.PROS*  Stable, soft foam stays in place without marking chairs*  Very easy to clean with one-piece constructionCONS*  Bulky on the go*  Will frustrate toddlers who like to climb into their own chair\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"My 16 month old daughter has gotten to the stage where she no longer wants to use a highchair or any of those other booster seats with the trays (ie. Tot-Loc, First Years 4 in 1 feeding seat, and First Years Folding Booster...all great products by the way)  She really just wanted to sit at the kitchen and dining room table like a big girl, and she didn't want to sit in the baby seats that allow you to convert them to big kid boosters by removing the trays.  We were at our wits end and after reading all the reviews here, we decided to give it a try, but I must admit we were a bit skeptical and nervous using this for our daughter because she is so young and most of the other reviewers said they used this for an older child.  Well our daughter absolutely loves this and is so proud of her upgrade from highchair to big kid comfy booster.  The booster wipes clean very easily, sticks to the chair very well, and the seat itself is non-slip, so our daugher does not slouch and side off this seat like she did with other hard plastic boosters.  Best of all, the seat brings her to the perfect height at our table (much better fit than the hard plastic boosters) and she appears to be much more comfortable (not to mention our once picky eater is now happily eating everything she sees now).  This booster seat seems to have completely changed the way my daughter looks at meal time for the better.  Also, the travel case this booster comes with is a nice touch, and it has room to pack a bib or small snack as well as the booster.  We're looking forward to using this booster for the next couple of years, and since it's so portable, we only need to buy one and just take it everywhere we go.One thing I should mention, I wouldn't buy this booster for a child who is overly active and doesn't like to sit still.  My daughter has no problems sitting still for extended periods as long as she is occupied, but if she were the kind of kid who always has to be moving at this age, I wouldn't use this booster just yet as it does not have any safety belt to hold your child in.\",\n",

The hard plastic seats slide around on wood chairs and never feel stable, even when strapped around the chair.  The trays don't leave enough room for a bigger child's legs.  However, this booster seats is soft and cushiony.  It feels stable on wood chairs, and it allows the child to sit at the big people's table.  Obviously, it's not as good for the young infant or younger toddler who needs a tray to contain the mess, but it's definitely better for the older toddler who knows how to eat neatly off a plate or bowl.  The older toddler hopefully is also well-trained enough to know not to jump around in the seat because it's not attached to the adult chair.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'After some little potty chair fails, I decided to try out a seat that fits on the big toilet. This one came up first as it has the most reviews, and it does for a reason. This seat works, period. I do have a girl though so I cant vouch if it works for the little guys.It has a device underneath that tightens it onto the big toilet seat. My toilet seat is the flat plastic kind so it went on with little problem. I have to finagle it a little, but it fits and is very secure so thats a win in my book.SIDE NOTE: Grandma owns the Fischer Price froggy potty which works perfectly, so if you are also thinking about getting a little chair, I highly recommend it.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Before buying this seat, we used a generic seat from a local department store that was padded and pretty flat, with a slight \"pee shield\" in front. It was pretty bulky and messy, so we looked elsewhere. The Bjorn Toilet Trainer is definitely more contoured to little peoples\\' bodies, which is great, but we still found it to be pretty messy.It fits our toilet great- it doesn\\'t slip at all. Sometimes, though, it will stick to my son\\'s skin after he\\'s been sitting on it for several minutes, so it pops up as he stands. I can\\'t really blame the Bjorn, though, as it seems to be just the fact that it is made out of plastic.I like that it is so slim, so it doesn\\'t add much height to the existing toilet. It\\'s easier for my son to sit down and stand up (with the help of a stool.) It\\'s also very simplistic, so it is easy to clean.Speaking of cleaning, though, I have to clean it after every single use. I guess I was hoping for a basic seat that would act exactly like a normal toilet seat- the child sits down, the pee goes in the toilet, and you flush it away. Unfortunately, whenever my son urinates, even when keeping his parts pointed down, the pee gets everywhere! Maybe it is our particular toilet or something, but the splashing created from sitting so close to the edge of the toilet makes quite a mess. The urine gets on the toilet seat, between the bjorn and the seat, and on the bjorn itself- up under the edges.Honestly, I\\'m not really sure how the device could be improved to prevent this issue. I\\'d say- spend less money for a basic seat that you still have to clean up, but at least you\\'d have saved money! If you buy this seat (at least, for a boy), keep some wipes handy to keep your toilet seat clean for others to use!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'We bought a couple of stand-alone potty seats a few months ago when our daughter was about 20 months old.  Although she was mildly intrigued by them at first and quickly learned what they were for, she seemed to view them more as glorified chairs rather than places to do her business.  Now that she\\'s nearing the two-and-a-half year mark, we decided to buy a toilet trainer seat to see if that would get her more engaged in the potty training process.  After reading tons of potty seat reviews, I decided to purchase this BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer, since it\\'s one of the few on the market that\\'s made of BPA-free, non-toxic polypropylene plastic instead of toxic PVC or vinyl.  As an added bonus, this toilet trainer seat is fully adjustable to fit practically any size toilet seat.  We have oval-shaped, elongated toilet seats in our home, and the BabyBjorn potty seat fits them perfectly.  This toilet trainer doesn\\'t slide around at all on the toilet seat, which helps my little-one to feel more secure while sitting on it.  Despite the exact fit, the toilet trainer seat is so easy to put on and remove that a preschooler could probably do it unassisted.  There\\'s a handy loop at the back of the seat so that you can hang it nearby for easy storage.  (We hang it on aPotty Hookthat hooks over our toilet tank).As I said in the title of this review, the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer would be just about perfect, if only it had handles for little-ones to hold onto.  Apparently, when toddlers first begin to use the \"grown-up toilet,\" many of them experience an innate fear of falling in, even when using a potty seat insert like this one.  Handles can help alleviate this fear by giving them something to hold onto to anchor themselves while sitting on the potty seat.  This was the case with my daughter.  When sitting on this toilet trainer seat, she couldn\\'t relax enough to urinate, much less have a bowel movement.  She would either hold my hands or grab onto the sides of the (unsanitary) toilet seat in order to steady herself, but even then, she still couldn\\'t relax enough to do her business.  On a hunch, I tried theArm & Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary, which is one of the few polypropylene potty seats that has handles.  The first time we used that seat, my daughter immediately grabbed onto the handles and peed for the first time in the toilet!  However, the Arm & Hammer potty seat is too small for my elongated toilet seat, and it\\'s not adjustable, so it constantly slides around when my daughter is on it.  And unfortunately, none of the adjustable potty seats that are readily available on the market (the BabyBjorn, Pourty Flexi-Fit and Prince Lionheart WeePod), has handles.I thought we were doomed to be stuck with the ill-fitting Arm & Hammer potty seat until I came across a nifty product called the \"SHANDLE\". The Shandle is a handle that sticks to the underside of your toilet seat with a strong, moisture-proof adhesive strip.  It\\'s intended to help little boys avoid touching the germy toilet seat by providing a more sanitary grab-handle for lifting and lowering the seat.  But the Shandle has turned out to be a perfect solution for us to the problem of using the handle-less BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer seat.  We just stuck a Shandle on each side of our toilet seat (around the same place that our daughter would grab onto the toilet seat), and voila!  She had two, secure handles to hold onto to anchor herself has she used the toilet trainer seat.  It doesn\\'t hurt that the Shandle comes in a variety of kid-friendly designs such as dinosaurs, martians and robots, which makes them attractive to toddlers.  (It also comes in elegant fashion prints and plain white, for those who prefer their bathrooms to have a more adult look).  Our daughter isn\\'t yet fully potty-trained, but now she\\'s comfortable enough to pee in the toilet while using her BabyBjorn potty seat, and she looks forward to using the \"big potty.\"  (So much so that she\\'s pretty much lost interest in her stand-alone \"baby\" potty!)If you\\'ve been holding off on getting this BabyBjorn potty seat because it doesn\\'t have handles, please Google \"Shandle\" and consider giving the product a try.  It was the perfect solution for us.Grade: A- (1 star deducted because the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer doesn\\'t have built-in handles).',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is a fantastic seat for these reasons:1. Doesn\\'t slide or wiggle on the toilet.2. Easy to clean!3. Pretty flat, light-weight compact design can pack easily in a suit case or other luggage for travel.4. Doesn\\'t pinch skin.5. Child doesn\\'t fall through hole (holds little behinds securely).6. Easily removeable for adult use of toilet.7. Carrying handle is great for kids and sanitary for moving the seat around.The only reason I did not give this seat 5 stars is if a little boy is sitting to go #1, you really have to make sure his \"aim\" is down otherwise as the force of urine stream hits the deflector it can splash up onto his legs a bit (nothing a bit of TP can\\'t hande, though). If the deflector were a tad higher this problem probably would go away. The other issue is that if his \"aim\" isn\\'t directed either right in the center of the deflector or right down into the bowl, the urine can splatter up under the deflector and make its way onto the toilet seat, toilet rim, and/or the back of the kid\\'s pants if the clothing is not pushed down beyond the gap between the toilet seat and rim.No problems with #2.Don\\'t forsee any trouble with little girl use either (daughter will use this seat in about 1 1/2 years).Despite the deflector issue - I would buy this product again there are too many other great attributes of it. All it means is a little extra foresight for mom and dad when he is getting ready to go.',\n",

However, the toilets in our home have elongated seats and many of the potty seats I looked at were made for standard toilet seats.  After reading numerous Amazon reviews, I decided to purchase the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer and am very pleased with my choice.The BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer sits on the seat and is then secured by turning a wheel at the back of the seat.  This moves two \"wings\" so that the seat attaches securely to the toilet seat, even if it is an elongated seat.  After securing the seat, I tried to wiggle the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer from side-to-side as might happen with a rambunctious toddler.  The seat held firmly in place.The splash guard at the front of the seat is sufficiently high to prevent accidental oversprays.  Further, it is curved so that liquids do not hit it and splash out the sides; they flow down into the toilet as they should.  The solid piece construction of the main seat prevents waste products from becoming trapped in grooves or joints and minimizes the possibility of odor.Further, the seat rinses off easily and can then be hung, by the large attached loop, to dripdry.  I hung a light S-shaped hook over the towelbar on the back wall of the bathtub and use it to hold the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer after it has been rinsed.If you are looking for a quality potty seat which will fit both standard and elongated toilet seats, you should definitely consider the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer.

       "  'reviewText': \"All the potty seats I looked at say they are for older children, including this one. My daughter is almost a year old. I had started, earlier this summer, putting her on the regular potty when I noticed her struggling with a #2. So rather than watching her be uncomfortable as she sat in her diaper or stood on her hands and feet in awkward positions, I decided to take her to the potty. It was tiring and uncomfortable holding her on the regular toilet seat, but using the toilet was effective at helping my daughter do the job she needed to do, plus I've saved several diapers this way.After reading many reviews, I decided to try the Babybjorn Toilet Trainer. It is perfect! My daughter seems comfortable on it, and I don't have to use as much strength to support her on the toilet since the Babybjorn seat provides a better and more stable sitting surface without me having to worry about her little bottom sinking into the toilet.I have a very small bathroom and just recently purchased a Potty Hook from Babies R Us. Now the potty seat hangs from the toilet tank and is easily accessible and neat looking.Pros:Sits securely on toilet seatEasy to cleanFlexible handle for hangingCons:Expensive (best price at my time of purchase was here at Amazon)I would recommend it, but I am wondering if the Arm and Hammer seat (which seems to be similar in shape) is comparable. It is less expensive. I would like to get another seat for Grandma and Papa's home, but am not sure if I want to spend the same amount of money I spent on the Babybjorn seat since my daughter will be at my home more than at her grandparents' home.\",\n",

I\\'ve returned 4 of them immediately after seeing how the design of the seat would not work for our son (I would have a little Bellagio Fountain spraying on my floor instead of the toilet).  The one seat that did end up staying in our house seemed great at first, but I later discovered that there were gaps on the bottle of the seat that captured urine and required constant cleaning.  So I sucked it up and threw down the money for the more expensive Baby Bjorn.  WHY didn\\'t I buy this sooner!?!?This is the best potty seat I purchased.  There are absolutely no hidden gaps or fabrics that can soak up or trap urine.  It is adjustable to fit into any type of toilet seat.  There is a small splash guard (more like a ridge) in the seat so no \"fountaining\" can occur.

I already have a Bjorn stand alone potty but my daughter didn't seem to be comfortable on it for more than a minute or two and she wanted to sit on the big potty but is just too small. So I figured a seat to go on the regular toilet would be the way to go. So far though it hasn't gotten her to go she does seem comfortable sitting on it. The design is really clever and I do believe that it would fit on any seat tightly the way it's adjustable. It's nice to feel comfortable that it's not going to slide around. I think this is definitely the way to go for toilet training.Update 11/21/2011: My daughter is now actually using the seat instead of just sitting on it:) This seat has successfully taught her how to use the potty. We like it so much that for our travels over the holidays we've ordered another seat to be sent to where we'll be spending the holidays so she'll have the exact same seat there. Very happy with this product. Also I've noticed that though she's a girl it's still helpful that this unit has a splash guard on it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'We have been using this potty for our 2 1/2 month old (yes, you read that correctly) for a few weeks now.  While she is still too small to actually sit on it by herself (she\\'d fall right in), we hold her over it when we think she needs to empty the tank and have had much success with it.  Before you jump down my throat over why I shouldn\\'t be using this for such a tiny baby, I\\'ll defend myself by saying sometimes she will fuss uncontrollably and it will calm her immediately to have her diaper removed and have the opportunity to relieve herself without the confines of a diaper.  This potty has been a wonderful solution to that problem.It\\'s definitely small, but since my baby is a particularly petite baby to begin with, I reckon she\\'ll probably be close to completely potty trained before she outgrows this.  It\\'s a nice size for us right now, however.Cleaning it is relatively simple with dumping the waste into the toilet, rinsing it out, then wiping it down with disinfecting wipes.  One feature I really would love to have in this is a pour spout somewhere to make dumping the waste a cleaner task.  Because of this lack of design feature, you are faced with two options when emptying the potty out: flip it upside-down really fast to avoid getting waste spread around the edges (never tried it...sounds too risky) or pour it out over the side and be faced with the waste spreading all over the side you dumped it from.  I\\'m sure nobody is a fan of dripping baby pee and poop or having to wipe up more than necessary.  A pour spout would have been a simple solution to this problem.Otherwise, we are completely pleased with this product.  I can imagine having a second one for the car down the line might be a good investment considering how reasonably priced it is.Update: We still use this now that our daughter is five months old.  We saw that Ikea has a $5 potty, so we got one to have a secondary use potty.  I hate to say it, but Ikea perfected the \"spout\" design to cleanly pour out waste.  The Ikea potty is bigger and the opening is wider, so we have to be more careful about her backside falling in and it appears to be a bit more uncomfortable for smaller babies.  For that reason, I still prefer the size and shape of the Baby Bjorn potty.  I wish these two potties could get together and create a perfect design for little babies :)',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I first got this for my 6month old son, after reading the \"Diaper free before 3\" book. In India, the grandmothers start potty training the babies well around 4-5 months when they start sitting with support. In the same aspect, I got this chair just to make sure my son sits on the potty chair when parents use the bathroom and it worked very well. I am writing this review since I dint see any other reviews for kids as young as 6 months.The first day, as soon as me and my son got up, we went to the bathroom and sat on our own potty chairs, surprisingly, he peed in this, on the first day only! From then on we are repeating it every day and he seems to understand he has to pee to get out of that chair and hence does it. He likes to sit on this one, as it has the backrest, and armrest for both of his arms and his foot has not yet touched the floor but, its good enough for him. In a way, its good that his foot has not touched the floor yet, as he doesnt try to stand up :-). He has one of his squirty friends or a book in his hands to keep him happy. Even if he tries to reach for something on the either side, the chair doesnt trip and it holds well.Every single time, I put him on this, any time of day, he pees assuming thats what I want him to do. Pooping, we have not started yet, but so far it has been easy to clean and the splash guard does work great, remove the inner seat and wash it in warm water, and its even sanitized!Its been about a month since I got the first potty and here I am ready to buy my second one for the bathroom on the first floor. I got the Fisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Potty but he doesnt like it since it has no back or arm rest! He wouldnt sit on it even once, and its going back to Amazon today while I order my second potty chair!',\n",

[more natural-leaf-looking than neon.]were not getting too serious about potty training, just yet, but we do set our daughter on the potty after naps. shes peed in it a couple times, now. the center \"potty bowl\" removes easily and doesnt force you to touch anywhere the pee has touched since it has a \"lip\" to grab up under the front \"horn\" of the bowl. you simply remove and dump the bowl part into the adult potty, maybe put a lil water in it from the faucet to rinse it and dump the contaminated water into the toilet, too. very, very easy to use. my daughter can sit on it herself [shes 13m] and stand up unassisted, as well. the back chair part aids her in sitting down so she doesnt plop down [like every child this age does] and lean back too far.the only down side i see with this potty is my daughters curious and wants to touch inside the bowl while sitting on the potty. but thats just a learning curve of whats \"yucky\" and shouldnt be touched. ;)overall, i recommend the baby bjorn potty chair because it doesnt have any bells and whistles [which i find pretty pointless for a get-down-to-business type of personal business,] its fairly inexpensive compaired to others out there, and its functional and safe [no leaning back too far.]',\n",

There's also a version without a &#34;chair&#34; back that is equally good; we have them both.PROS:-- ergonomic, comfortable for toddlers and even infants if you are doing elimination communication-- all molded plastic design makes it easy to keep clean, no cushion to get soggy-- insert lifts out for easy dumping into adult toilet, fits in sink for washing clean-- sturdy base ensures your kid will not tip it over, even if wiggly-- spray guard works well for boys but still is small enough to let kids get on easilyCONS-- your toddler may not want to transition to big toilet because these are so comfortableI really can't think of any cons for these potties.  We have one in each bathroom, and when my son was learning, we kept one in his bedroom as well.  We have a smaller version of this one that stays in the back of our car for those unforeseen &#34;I have to go potty NOW&#34; incidents.  They are so sturdy, are easy to clean and maintain, and my toddler can even empty this one easily himself without making a mess.  Some potties have cushions and other moving parts, making it really complicated to disassemble for emptying.  This one is a breeze.Also, the bowl is oval shaped and plenty long enough to accommodate larger toddlers without having positioning issues.  I've seen some that have a tiny circular opening, which is really awkward, especially for boys, to make sure nothing misses...GREAT FOR EC - If you do elimination communication or infant pottying, these are great.  The insert can be removed and held in your lap -- used as a top hat potty -- until your child is old enough to sit freely on the potty.I absolutely LOVE these potties because they are so practical, simple to use, and child friendly.  My toddler prefers this style to all the other ones he's tried.  No gimmicks, just a potty.  What you need.\",\n",

It's a perfect potty chair. There are only 2 pieces and NO nooks to squeeze into to clean. it's very simple in design. It has a wonderful pee guard for my boy and he never gets the pee on the floor. He actually sits back a bit and watchs himself pee. I just love this potty for the ease of cleaning it. I just lift out the bowl, dump and rinse. It's good to go.At the end of the day, I just spray a little Clorox anywhere on it and let it dry for the next day. My son loves it, too. Its very comfortable and easy for him to use on his own. When we were doing the naked potty training (now we hav emoved to underwear! yah!) he was able to get to the potty and go all by himself without trying to get a lid off like the previous potty we bought. He would sometimes just sit there for a decent period of time just waiting. He was totally comfortable. LOVE this potty and we will be using it again with our second boy due in a few months.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'For nearly a year, I have been struggling to help my now three-year-old become potty trained.  We have tried four other potty seats, and all have proved difficult to use:-We first tried the Primo Ducka toilet seat (looks like a duck), and while it was cute and engaging, he could not climb on the toilet to use it by himself, and it often directed the liquid flow right between the toilet and seat (what a mess!).-Next, we used an old-fashioned wooden potty chair (the kind with a high back and arm rests), but this had a separate plastic guard that hurt my son and also allowed liquid to leak.-The third potty chair we tried was the Baby Bjorn Little Potty, which slid too easily on our bathroom floor, was too low to the ground, and always allowed liquid to drip along the outside when tipped in the toilet during cleaning.-My son did enjoy the next potty - a \"Peter Potty\" toddler urinal.  It was great fun to stand like Daddy, and it even had a water tank so that it could be \"flushed\" like a real potty.  After several months, however, the top water tank started dripping often, and the bottom reservoir was so hard to pull out that when it finally let loose, liquid sloshed out!Frustrated, I set out to scour Amazon for one final shot at a potty that would work for my son and would be easy to clean.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided upon the Baby Bjorn potty chair, allowed my son to be involved by selecting a color (blue)...and couldn\\'t be happier with our choice!My son has been excited about his new blue Baby Bjorn potty chair since the UPS driver brought it to our house, and I am impressed as well.  This potty chair is tall enough that it is comfortable for him to sit upon, there are no separate guards that pinch him, the rubber bottom prevents it from sliding on our floor, it has a back and armrests that help my son stand up after going potty, he can use it by himself, AND it\\'s super easy to clean!  I have found that if you pour the liquid out the back of the potty chair insert (where the white bowl curves upward), the liquid does not run down the outside of the container like other potty chairs.Overall, while a bit pricey, this is without a doubt the best potty chair we have found for our toddler boy.  I would highly recommend that other parents try this chair before wasting their money on any others!',\n",

We have always just had a cushioned training seat on the big potty, and had recently gotten a potty seat with an attached \"step ladder\", but she had trouble getting her pants down safely once she was up there, so she couldn\\'t REALLY go and do it by herself.  I thought I would give the floor-potty a chance, and got this one.  She immediately said \"I want to go pee pee!\" and so I showed her that she couljd stand on the floor, take off her own pants/pull-up and go...she did, and the potty is super sturdy, it\\'s the perfect size for her tiny little hiney (she\\'s only 23.6lbs at a little over 2yrs!), and she had no trouble at all getting on or getting up...the \"arm rests\" were a great way to help herself get back up - might want to consider that if you are considering the smaller Bjorn potty chair.  It emptied easy as pie, and was ridiculously easy to clean and sanitize...but once I did that, she grabbed it and put it back in the shipping box...she just prefers the seats on the \"big girl potty\".  Otherwise, great little chair, for sure.I would mention, the \"lip\" that is there to prevent issues for little boys or \"forward spillage\" during a pee, might prove a little tough to maneuver or might get a little boy caught on it...I\\'m sure they have to be high enough to actually prevent the spill/splash, but this one took my daughter a moment to get over the little hump, and being a girl she doesn\\'t even have the \"extra accessories\".',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I almost passed over this potty for something with more bells and whistles.  There were potties that converted into stepping stools and one that had a handle that played flushing sounds when depressed.  $27 seemed a little expensive for two pieces of molded plastic (bowl and base) that made up the entire Bjorn potty get up.  In the end, I'm happy with my Bjorn purchase.  The simple design is easy to clean.  My son is well supported in the ergonomic seat that has a wide base and rubber footings so I don't have to worry about him squirming and tipping over.  The bowl is big enough to catch all of his deposits.  Some of the potties I've seen have very small bowls which I'd imagine to be difficult targets for little behinds.  My only gripe is that my little boy sometimes sprays over the splash guard and wets his clothes.  So perhaps Bojorn should look into tweeking that part of their design.\",\n",

I'm guessing he was around 2.5 years old.It came with 2 pieces: a base and a cup.The base has a wide, stable bottom on it to prevent tipping and a nice back on it. There is rubber on the bottom to add stability and keep the potty from sliding across the floor. There are no sharp corners  - just curves which are very easy to keep clean. There is a hole in the base; the cup is set into this hole, overlapping the edges. The edges all slope towards the cup so any liquid drains into the cup.The deflector is not removable; it is all one piece with the cup. I LOVE this design. It is smooth so that it will not scratch tender body parts and it cannot get lost.The cup is removed from the TOP of the base! With my other potty, I had to turn it around and remove the cup from underneath the seat. If my toddler ever tried to empty it himself, he ended up making a big mess. With this potty, it was a lot easier for him to empty it without spilling.Having the cup on top also means that he is sitting on the edges of the cup. There are no gaps or tight corners for pee to get into. The deflector could be a little higher in our experience, but it wasn't too bad. I think if it was taller, it might be annoying for a girl so I can understand why it is the height that it is.An added bonus is that this potty chair is not an eyesore. It's rounded corners and pleasing colours are easy to look at.\",\n",

We decided on the BABYBJORN potty chair because it seemed easy to clean, comfortable, and didn't have anything that would make her want to continue to use it as opposed the the real potty.We bought this when she was 2 just to get her used to it.  She sat on it while we were in the bathroom and read her books.  She was comfortable and nothing pinched her causing her to not want to use it. Eventually she got the idea and started using it herself.  At 2 and a half we ditched diapers and were exclusice to the potty training.She loved this chair because, gross, she loved to pick up the seat and dump the contents in the real potty.  Lucky for us there wasn't any huge mess.  We rinsed the chair out nightly with hot water and I cleaned her potty when we cleaned our bathroom, weekly.  She made sure I did as well.  She enjoyed using this potty, but when the time came to move exclusively to the big potty she wasn't sad to see this go.I'm very happy with this purchase and will purchase another one when we potty train my son.  Reason being I think I accidently tossed this in a made rage to declutter.Overall, cleans very easily, no weird places for poop or pee to hide, and she didn't become attached to it.\",\n",

I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around.
